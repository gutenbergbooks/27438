<h3>&#8220;ME&mdash;SMITH&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>A man on a tired gray horse reined in where
a dim cattle-trail dropped into a gulch, and looked
behind him. Nothing was in sight. He half closed
his eyes and searched the horizon. No, there was
nothing&mdash;just the same old sand and sage-brush,
hills, more sand and sage-brush, and then to the
west and north the spur of the Rockies, whose
jagged peaks were white with a fresh fall of snow.
The wind was chill. He shivered, and looked to the
eastward. For the last few hours he had felt snow
in the air, and now he could see it in the dim,
gray mist&mdash;still far off, but creeping toward him.</p>
<p>For the thousandth time, he wondered where he
was. He knew vaguely that he was &#8220;over the line&#8221;&mdash;that
Montana was behind him&mdash;but he was riding
an unfamiliar range, and the peaks and hills which
are the guide-boards of the West meant nothing
to him. So far as he knew, he was the only human
being within a hundred miles. His lips drew back
in a half-grin and exposed a row of upper teeth
unusually white and slightly protruding. He was
thinking of the meeting with the last person to
whom he had spoken within twenty-four hours.
He closed one eye and looked up at the sun. Yes,
it was just about the same time yesterday that a
dude from the English ranch, a dude in knee
breeches and shiny-topped riding boots, had galloped
confidently toward him. He had dismounted
and pretended to be cinching his saddle. When
the dude was close enough Smith had thrown down
on him with his gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feller,&#8221; he had said, &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll have to trade
horses with you. And fall off quick, for I&#8217;m in
kind of a hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The grin widened as he thought of the dude&#8217;s
surprised eyes and the dude&#8217;s face as he dropped
out of the saddle without a word. Smith had
stood his victim with his hands above his head
while he pulled the saddle from his horse and threw
it upon his own. The dude rode a saddle with
a double cinch, and the fact had awakened in
the Westerner a kind of interest. He had even
felt a certain friendliness for the man he was robbing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feller,&#8221; he had asked, &#8220;do you come from
the Mañana country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From Chepstow, Monmouth County, Wales,&#8221;
the dude had replied, in a shaking voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you get that double-rigged saddle,
then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Texas.&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer had pleased Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t losin&#8217; none on this deal,&#8221; he had
then volunteered. &#8220;This horse that you just
traded for is a looker when he is rested, and he
can run like hell. You can go your pile on him.
Just burn out that lazy S brand and run on your
own. You can hold him easy, then. I like a
feller that rides a double-rigged saddle in a single-rigged
country. S&#8217;long, and keep your hands up
till I&#8217;m out of range.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; the dude had replied feebly.</p>
<p>When Smith had ridden for a half a mile he
had turned to look behind him. The dude was
still standing with his hands high above his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if he&#8217;s there yet?&#8221; The man on
horseback grinned.</p>
<p>He reached in the pocket of his mackinaw coat
and took out a handful of sugar.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can travel longer on it nor anything,&#8221;
he muttered.</p>
<p>He congratulated himself that he had filled his
pocket from the booze-clerk&#8217;s sugar-bowl before the
mix came. The act was characteristic of him, as
was the forethought which had sent him to the door
to pick the best saddle-horse at the hitching-post,
before the lead began to fly.</p>
<p>The man suddenly realized that the mist in the
east was denser, and spreading. He jabbed the
spurs into his horse and sent the jaded animal
sliding on its fetlocks down the steep and rocky
trail that led into the dry bed of a creek which
in the spring flowed bank high. In the bottom
he pulled his horse to its haunches and leaned from
his saddle to look at a foot-print in a little patch
of smooth sand no larger than his two hands.
The print had been made by a moccasined foot, and
recently; otherwise the wind would have wiped it
out.</p>
<p>He threw his leg over the cantle of the saddle
and stepped softly to the ground. Dropping the
reins, he looked up and down the gulch. Then
he drew his rifle from the scabbard and began to
hunt for more tracks. As he searched, his movements
were no longer those of a white man. His
pantomime, stealthy, cautious, was the pantomime
of the Indian. He crept up the gulch to a point
where it turned sharply. His stealth became the
stealth of the coyote. In spite of the leather soles
and exaggerated high heels of the boots he wore
his movements were absolutely noiseless.</p>
<p>An Indian of middle age, in blue overalls, moccasins,
a limp felt hat coming far down over his
braided hair, a gaily striped blanket drawn about
his shoulders, stood in an attitude of listening,
carelessly holding a cheap, single-barrelled shotgun.
He had heard the horse sliding down the
trail and was waiting for it to appear on the
bench above.</p>
<p>The stranger took in the details of the Indian&#8217;s
costume, but his eye rested longest upon the gay
blanket. He might need a blanket with that snow
in the air. It looked like a good blanket. It
seemed to be thick and was undoubtedly warm.</p>
<p>The Indian saw him the instant he rose from
his hiding-place behind a huge sage-brush.
Startled, the red man instinctively half raised his
gun. The stranger gave the sign of attention,
then, touching his breast and lifting his hand
slightly, told him in the sign language used by
all tribes that &#8220;his heart was right&#8221;&mdash;he was a
friend.</p>
<p>The Indian hesitated and lowered his gun, but
did not advance. The stranger then asked him
where he would find the nearest house, and whether
it was that of a white or a red man. In swift
pantomime, the Indian told him that the nearest
house was the home of a &#8220;full-blood,&#8221; a woman,
a fat woman, who lived five miles to the southeast,
in a log cabin, on running water.</p>
<p>Before he turned to go, the stranger again
touched his breast and raised his hand above his
heart to reiterate his friendship. He took a half-dozen
steps, then whirled on his heel. As he did so,
he brought his rifle on a line with the Indian&#8217;s
back, which was toward him. Simultaneously with
the report, the Indian fell on his back on the side
of the gulch. He drew up his leg, and the
stranger, thinking he had raised it for a gun-rest,
riddled him with bullets.</p>
<p>The white man&#8217;s bright blue eyes gleamed; the
pupils were like pin-points. The grin which disclosed
his protruding teeth was like the snarl of a
dog before it snaps. The expression of the man&#8217;s
face was that of animal ferocity, pure and simple.
He edged up cautiously, but there was no further
movement from the Indian. He had been dead
when he fell. The white man gave a short laugh
when he realized that the raising of the leg had
been only a muscular contraction. To save the
blanket from the blood which was soiling it, he
tore it from the limp, unresisting shoulders, and
rubbed it in the dirt to obliterate the stain. He
cursed when he saw that a bullet had torn in it two
jagged, tell-tale holes.</p>
<p>He glanced at the Indian&#8217;s moccasins, then,
stooping, ripped one off. He examined it with interest.
It was a Cree moccasin. The Indian was
far from home. He examined the centre seam:
yes, it was sewed with deer-sinew.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Crees can tan to beat the world,&#8221; he muttered,
&#8220;but I hates the shape of the Cree moccasin.
The Piegans make better.&#8221; He tossed it
from him contemptuously and picked up the shotgun.</p>
<p>&#8220;No good.&#8221; He threw it down and straightened
the Indian&#8217;s head with the toe of his boot.
&#8220;I despises to lie cramped up, myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Returning to his horse, he removed his saddle,
and folded the Indian&#8217;s blanket inside of his own.
Then he recinched his saddle, and turned his horse&#8217;s
head to the southeast, where &#8220;the full-blood&mdash;the
woman, the fat woman&mdash;lived in a log cabin by
running water.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced over his shoulder as he spurred his
horse to a gallop.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a killer, me&mdash;Smith,&#8221; he said, and grinned.</p>

<h2>II</h2>
<h3>ON THE ALKALI HILL</h3>
</div>

<p>There was at least an hour and a half of daylight
left when Smith struck a wagon-road. He
looked each way doubtfully. The woman&#8217;s house
was quite as likely to be to the right as to the
left; there was no way of telling. While he hesitated,
his horse lifted its ears. Smith also thought
he heard voices. Swinging his horse to the right,
he rode to the edge of the bench where the road
made a steep and sudden drop.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the hill he saw a driver on
the spring-seat of a round-up wagon urging two
lean-necked and narrow-chested horses up the hill.
They were smooth-shod, and, the weight of the
wagon being out of all proportion to their
strength, they fell often in their futile struggles.
At the side of the road near the top of the hill
the water oozed from an alkali spring, which kept
the road perpetually muddy. The horses were
straining every nerve and muscle, their eyes bulging
and nostrils distended, and still the driver, loudmouthed
and vacuously profane, lashed them mercilessly
with the stinging thongs of his leather
whip. Smith, from the top of the hill, watched
him with a sneer on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;He drives like a Missourian,&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>He could have helped the troubled driver, knowing
perfectly well what to do, but it would have
entailed an effort which he did not care to make.
It was nothing to him whether the round-up wagon
got up the hill that night&mdash;or never.</p>
<p>Smith thought the driver was alone until he
began to back the team to rush the hill once more.
Then he heard angry exclamations coming from
the rear of the wagon&mdash;exclamations which sounded
not unlike the buzzing of an enraged bumble-bee.
He stretched his neck and saw that which suggested
an overgrown hoop-snake rolling down the hill. At
the bottom a little mud-coated man stood up. The
part of his face that was visible above his beard
was pale with anger. His brown eyes gleamed behind
mud-splashed spectacles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oscar Tubbs,&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;why did you not
tell me that you were about to back the wagon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would have did it if I had knowed myself
that the team were goin&#8217; to back,&#8221; replied Tubbs,
in the conciliatory tone of one who addresses the
man who pays him his wages.</p>
<p>The man in spectacles groaned. &#8220;Three inexcusable
errors in one sentence. Oscar Tubbs, you
are hopeless!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; replied that person resignedly; &#8220;nobody
never could learn me nothin&#8217;. Onct I
knowed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop! We have no time for a reminiscence.
Have you any reason to believe that we can get
up this hill to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No chanst of it. These buzzard-heads has
drawed every poun&#8217; they kin pull. But I has some
reason to believe that if you don&#8217;t hist your hoofs
out&#8217;n that mud-hole, you&#8217;ll bog down. You&#8217;re up
to your pant-leg now. Onct I knowed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The little man threw out his hand in a restraining
gesture, and Tubbs, foiled again, closed his
lips and watched his employer stand back on one
leg while he pulled the other out of the mud with
a long, sucking sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for an outfit is that, anyhow?&#8221; mused
Smith, watching the proceedings with some interest.
&#8220;He looks like one of them bug-hunters. He&#8217;s
got a pair of shoulders on him like a drink of
water, and his legs look like the runnin&#8217;-gears
of a katydid.&#8221;</p>
<p>So intently were they all engaged in watching
the man&#8217;s struggles that no one observed a girl
on a galloping horse until she was almost upon
them. She sat her sturdy, spirited pony like a
cowboy. She was about sixteen, with a suggestion
of boyishness in her appearance. Her brown hair,
worn in a single braid, was bleached to a lighter
shade on top, as if she rode always with bared
head. Her eyes were gray, in curious contrast
to a tawny skin. She was slight to scrawniness,
and, one might have thought, insufficiently clad for
the time of year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bogged down, pardner?&#8221; she inquired in a
friendly voice, as she rode up behind and drew
rein. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been in that soap-hole myself. Here,
ketch to my pommel, and I&#8217;ll snake you out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smiling dubiously he gripped the pommel. The
pony had sunk to its knees, and as it leaped to
free itself the little man&#8217;s legs fairly snapped in
the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you, Miss,&#8221; he said, removing his plaid
travelling cap as he dropped on solid ground.
&#8220;That was really quite an adventure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This mud is like grease,&#8221; said the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Onct I knowed some mud&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began the
driver, but the little man, ignoring him, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in a dilemma, Miss. Our horses seem
unable to pull our wagon up the hill. Night is
almost upon us, and our next camping spot is
several miles beyond.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the worst grade in the country,&#8221; replied
the girl. &#8220;A team that can haul a load up
here can go anywhere. What&#8217;s the matter with
that fellow up there? Why don&#8217;t he help?&#8221;&mdash;pointing
to Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has made no offer of assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be some Scissor-Bill from Missouri.
They all act like that when they first come out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Onct some Missourians I knowed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oscar Tubbs, if you attempt to relate another
reminiscence while in my employ, I shall make a
deduction from your wages. I warn you&mdash;I warn
you in the presence of this witness. My overwrought
nerves can endure no more. Between your
inexpiable English and your inopportune reminiscences,
I am a nervous wreck!&#8221; The little man&#8217;s
voice ended on high C.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Doc, suit yourself,&#8221; replied Tubbs,
temporarily subdued.</p>
<p>&#8220;And in Heaven&#8217;s name, I entreat, I implore,
do not call me &#8216;Doc&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry I spoke, Cap.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little man threw up both hands in exasperation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Mister,&#8221; said the girl curtly to Tubbs,
&#8220;if you&#8217;ll take that hundred and seventy pounds
of yourn off the wagon and get some rocks and
block the wheels, I guess my cayuse can help
some.&#8221; As she spoke, she began uncoiling the
rawhide riata which was tied to her saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I appreciate the kindness of your intentions,
Miss, but I cannot permit you to put yourself in
peril.&#8221; The little man was watching her preparations
with troubled eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;No peril at all. It&#8217;s easy. Croppy can pull
like the devil. Wait till you see him lay down
on the rope. That yap up there at the top of
the hill could have done this for you long ago.
Here, Windy&#8221;&mdash;addressing Tubbs&mdash;&#8220;tie this rope
to the X, and make a knot that will hold.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;SHE&#8217;S A GAME KID, ALL RIGHT,&#8221; SAID SMITH TO HIMSELF AT THE TOP OF THE HILL.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The girl&#8217;s words and manner inspired confidence.
Interest and relief were in the face of the little
man standing at the side of the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Windy, hand me the rope. I&#8217;ll take
three turns around my saddle-horn, and when I
say &#8217;go&#8217; you see that your team get down in
their collars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a game kid, all right,&#8221; said Smith to
himself at the top of the hill.</p>
<p>When the sorrel pony at the head of the team
felt the rope grow taut on the saddle-horn, it lay
down to its work. The grit and muscle of a
dozen horses seemed concentrated in the little cayuse.
It pulled until every vein and cord in its
body appeared to stand out beneath its skin. It
lay down on the rope until its chest almost touched
the ground. There was a look of determination
that was almost human in its bright, excited eyes
as it strained and struggled on the slippery hillside
with no word of urging from the girl. She
was standing in one stirrup, one hand on the cantle,
the other on the pommel, watching everything with
keen eyes. She issued orders to Tubbs like a general,
telling him when to block the wheels, when
to urge the exhausted team to greater efforts,
when to relax. Nothing escaped her. She and
the little sorrel knew their work. As the man
at the roadside watched the gallant little brute
struggle, literally inch by inch, up the terrible
grade he felt himself choking with excitement and
making inarticulate sounds. At last the rear
wheels of the wagon lurched over the hill and stood
on level ground, while the horses, with spreading
legs and heaving sides, gasped for breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Awful tired, ain&#8217;t you, Mister?&#8221; the girl asked
dryly, of the stranger on horseback, as she recoiled
her rope with supple wrist and tied it again to the
saddle by the buckskin thongs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plumb worn to a frazzle,&#8221; Smith replied with
cool impudence, as he looked her over in much the
same manner as he would have eyed a heifer on
the range. &#8220;I was whipped for working when I
was a boy, and I&#8217;ve always remembered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be quite a ride&mdash;from the brush back
there in Missouri where you was drug up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ranges on the Sundown slope,&#8221; he replied
shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have sheep-camps over there, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the slurring insinuation pricked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can twist a rope and ride a horse fast
enough to keep warm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So?&#8221;&mdash;the inflection was tantalizing. &#8220;Was
that horse gentled for your grandmother?&#8221;</p>
<p>He eyed her angrily, but checked the reply on
his tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, girl, can you tell me where I can find that
fat Injun woman&#8217;s tepee who lives around here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean my mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her with new interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does she live in a log cabin on a crick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did about an hour ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your mother a widder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lookin&#8217; for widders?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I likes widders. It happens frequent that widders
are sociable inclined&mdash;especially if they are
hard up,&#8221; he added insolently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re ridin&#8217; the grub-line?&#8221; Her insolence
equalled his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet;&#8221; and he took from his pocket a thick
roll of banknotes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blood money? Some sheep-herder&#8217;s month&#8217;s
pay, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good guesser.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very&mdash;you&#8217;re easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s dislike for Smith was as unreasoning
and violent as was her liking for the excitable
little man whom she had helped up the hill, and
whose wagon was now rumbling close at her horse&#8217;s
heels.</p>
<p>They all travelled together in silence until, after
a mile and a half on the flat, the road sloped
gradually toward a creek shadowed by willows. On
the opposite side of the creek were a ranch-house,
stables, and corrals, the extent of which brought a
glint of surprise to Smith&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where the widder lives who might be
sociable inclined if she was hard up,&#8221; said the girl,
with a sneer which made Smith&#8217;s fingers itch to
choke her. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t coax you to stop, could I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I aims to stay,&#8221; Smith replied coolly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure&mdash;it won&#8217;t cost you nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl waited for the wagon, and, with a
change of manner in marked contrast to her impudent
attitude toward Smith, invited the little
man to spend the night at the ranch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should not be intruders?&#8221; he asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t feel lonesome,&#8221; she answered with
a laugh. &#8220;We keep a kind of free hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Colonel, I cakalate we better lay over here,&#8221;
broke in Tubbs.</p>
<p>His employer winced at this new title, but nodded
assent; so they all forded the shallow stream
and entered the dooryard together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221; called the girl.</p>
<p>One of the heavy plank doors of the long log-house
opened, and a short woman, large-hipped,
full-busted&mdash;in appearance a typical blanket squaw&mdash;stood
in the doorway. Her thick hair was
braided Indian fashion, her fingers adorned with
many rings. The wide girdle about her waist was
studded with brass nail-heads, while gaily-beaded
moccasins covered her short, broad feet. Her eyes
were soft and luminous, like an animal&#8217;s when it
is content; but there was savage passion too in
their dark depths.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my mother,&#8221; said the girl briefly. &#8220;I
am Susie MacDonald.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Peter McArthur, madam.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little man concealed his surprise as best he
could, and bowed.</p>
<p>The girl, quick to note his puzzled expression,
explained laconically:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a breed. My father was a white man.
You&#8217;re on the reservation when you cross the crick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recovering himself, the stranger said politely:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, MacDonald&mdash;that good Scotch name is a
very familiar one to me. I had an uncle&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I go show dem where to turn de horses,&#8221; interrupted
the Indian woman, to whom the conversation
was uninteresting. So, without ceremony,
she padded away in her moccasins, drawing her
blanket squaw-fashion across her face as she waddled
down the path.</p>
<p>At the mission the woman had obtained the rudiments
of an education. There, too, she had learned
to cut and make a dress, after a crude, laborious
fashion, and had acquired the ways of the white
people&#8217;s housekeeping. She was noted for the
acumen which she displayed in disposing of the
crop from her extensive hay-ranch to the neighboring
white cattlemen; and MacDonald, the big,
silent Scotch MacDonald who had come down from
the north country and married her before the reservation
priest, was given the credit for having instilled
into her some of his own shrewdness and
thrift.</p>
<p>In the corral the Indian woman came upon Smith.
He turned his head slowly and looked at her. For
a second, two, three seconds, or more, they looked
into each other&#8217;s eyes. His gaze was confident,
masterful, compelling; hers was wondering, until
finally she dropped her eyes in the submissive,
modest, half-shy way of Indian women.</p>
<p>Smith moistened his short upper lip with the
tip of his tongue, while the shadow of a smile
lurked at the corner of his mouth. He turned
to his saddle, again, and without speaking, she
watched him until he had gone into the barn. His
saddle lay on the ground, half covering his blankets.
Something in this heap caught the woman&#8217;s eyes
and held them. Swooping forward, she caught a
protruding corner between her thumb and finger
and pulled a gay, striped blanket from the rest.
Lifting it to her nose, she smelled it. Smith saw
the act as he came out of the door, but there was
neither consternation nor fear in his face. Smith
knew Indian women.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<h3>THE EMPTY CHAIR</h3>
</div>

<p>Peter McArthur came into the big living-room
of the ranch-house bearing tenderly in his
arms a long brown sack. He set it upon a chair,
and, as he patted it affectionately, he said to the
Indian woman in explanation:</p>
<p>&#8220;These are some specimens which I have been
fortunate enough to find in a limestone formation
in the country through which we have just passed.
No doubt you will be amused, madam, but the
wealth of Cr&oelig;sus could not buy from me the contents
of this canvas sack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I broke a horse for that son-of-a-gun onct. He
owes me a dollar and six bits for the job yet,&#8221;
remarked Tubbs.</p>
<p>The fire of enthusiasm died in McArthur&#8217;s eyes
as they rested upon his man.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for a prospect do you aim to open up
in a limestone formation?&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith, tipped on the rear legs of his chair, with
his head resting comfortably against the unbleached
muslin sheeting which lined the walls, winked at
Tubbs as he asked the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What for a prospect&#8217;?&#8221; repeated McArthur.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, &#8216;prospect&#8217;&mdash;that&#8217;s what I said. You
say you&#8217;ve got your war-bag full of spec&#8217;mens.&#8221;</p>
<p>McArthur laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, my dear sir, I understand. You are referring
to mines&mdash;to mineral specimens. These are
the specimens of which I am speaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Opening the sack, McArthur held up for inspection
what looked to be a lump of dried mud.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a magnificent specimen of the crustacean
period,&#8221; he declared.</p>
<p>The Indian woman looked from the prized object
to his animated face; then, with puzzled eyes, she
looked at Smith, who touched his forehead with his
finger, making a spiral, upward gesture which in
the sign language says &#8220;crazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman promptly gathered up the rag rug
she was braiding and moved to a bench in the farthermost
corner of the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can get you a wagon-load of chunks like
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear sir&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Smith&#8217;s my name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Smith&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I trusts no man that &#8217;Misters&#8217; me,&#8221; Smith
scowled. &#8220;Every time I&#8217;ve ever been beat in a
deal, it&#8217;s been by some feller that&#8217;s called me
&#8217;Mister.&#8217; Jest Smith suits me better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, if you prefer,&#8221; amicably replied
McArthur, although unenlightened by the explanation.</p>
<p>He replaced his specimen and tied the sack,
convinced that it would be useless to explain to
this person that fossils like this were not found
by the wagon-load; that perhaps in the entire world
there was not one in which the branchiocardiac
grooves were so clearly defined, in which the emostigite
and the ambulatory legs were so perfectly
preserved.</p>
<p>He seemed a singular person, this Smith.
McArthur was not sure that he fancied him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Guv&#8217;ner, what business do you follow,
anyhow?&#8221; Tubbs asked the question in the tone
of one who really wanted to get at the bottom
of a matter which had troubled him. &#8220;Air you a
bug-hunter by trade, or what? I&#8217;ve hauled you
around fer more&#8217;n a month now, and ain&#8217;t figgered
it out what you&#8217;re after. We&#8217;ve dug up ant-hills
and busted open most of the rocks between here
and the North Fork of Powder River, but I&#8217;ve
never seen you git anything yet that anybuddy&#8217;d
want.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the beginning of their tour, Tubbs&#8217;s questions
and caustic comment would have given McArthur
offense, but a longer acquaintance had taught him
that none was intended; that his words were merely
those of a man entirely without knowledge upon
any subject save those which had come under his
direct observation. While Tubbs frequently exasperated
him beyond expression, he found at the
same time a certain fascination in the man&#8217;s incredible
ignorance. In many respects his mind
was like that of a child, and his horizon as narrow
as McArthur&#8217;s own, though his companion did not
suspect it. The little scientist saw life from the
viewpoint of a small college and a New England
village; Tubbs knew only the sage-brush plains.</p>
<p>McArthur now replied dryly, but without irritation:</p>
<p>&#8220;My real trade&mdash;&#8216;job,&#8217; if you prefer&mdash;is anthropology.
Strictly speaking, I might, I think, be
called an anthropologist.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gawd, feller!&#8221; ejaculated Smith in mock dismay.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t tip your hand like that. I&#8217;m a
killer myself, but I plays a lone game. I opens
up to no man or woman livin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tubbs looked slightly ashamed of his employer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, never give nobody the cinch on you.
Many a good man&#8217;s tongue has hung him.&#8221;</p>
<p>McArthur studied Smith&#8217;s unsmiling face in perplexity,
not at all sure that he was not in earnest.</p>
<p>They sat in silence after this, even Tubbs being
too hungry to indulge in reminiscence.</p>
<p>The odor of frying steak filled the room, and
the warmth from the round sheet-iron stove gave
Smith, in particular, a delicious sense of comfort.
He felt as a cat on a comfortable cushion must
feel after days and nights of prowling for food
and shelter. The other two men, occupied with
their own thoughts, closed their eyes; but not
so Smith. Nothing, to the smallest detail, escaped
him. He appraised everything with as perfect an
appreciation of its value as an auctioneer.</p>
<p>Through the dining-room door which opened into
the kitchen, he could see the kitchen range&mdash;a big
one&mdash;the largest made for private houses. Smith
liked that. He liked things on a big scale. Besides,
it denoted generosity, and he had come to regard
a woman&#8217;s kitchen as an index to her character.
He distinctly approved of the big meat-platter
upon which the Chinese cook was piling
steak. He eyed the mongrel dog lying at the
Indian woman&#8217;s feet, and noted that its sides were
distended with food. He was prejudiced against,
suspicious of, a woman who kept lean dogs.</p>
<p>In the same impersonal way in which he eyed
her belongings, he looked at the woman who owned
it all. She was far too stout to please his taste,
but he liked her square shoulders and the thickness
of them; also her hair, which was long for
an Indian woman&#8217;s. She was too short in the body.
He wondered if she rode. He had a peculiar aversion
for women short in the body who rode on
horseback. This woman could love&mdash;all Indian
women can do that, as Smith well knew&mdash;love to
the end, faithfully, like dogs.</p>
<p>In the general analysis of his surroundings, Smith
looked at Tubbs, openly sneering as he eyed him.
He was like a sheep-dog that never had been
trained. And McArthur? Innocent as a yearling
calf, and honest as some sky-pilots.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glub&#8217;s piled!&#8221; yelled the cook from the kitchen
door. &#8220;Come an&#8217; git it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tubbs all but fell off his chair.</p>
<p>At the back door the cook hammered on a huge
iron triangle with a poker, in response to which
sound a motley half-dozen men filed from a nearby
bunk-house at a gait very nearly resembling a
trot.</p>
<p>The long dining-table was covered with a red
table-cloth, and at each end piles of bread and
fried steak rose like monuments. At each place
there was a platter, and beside it a steel knife,
a fork, and a tin spoon.</p>
<p>The bunk-house crowd wasted no time in ceremony.
Poising their forks above the meat-platter
in a candid search for the most desirable piece,
they alternately stabbed chunks of steak and bread.</p>
<p>Their platters once loaded with a generous
sample of all the food in sight, they fell upon it
with unconcealed relish. Eating, McArthur observed,
was a business; there was no time for the
amenities of social intercourse until the first pangs
of hunger were appeased. The Chinese cook, too,
interested him as he watched him shuffling over the
hewn plank floor in his straw sandals. A very different
type, this swaggering Celestial, from the
furtive-eyed Chinamen of the east. His tightly
coiled cue was as smooth and shining as a king-snake,
his loose blouse was immaculate, and the
flippant voice in which he demanded in each person&#8217;s
ear, &#8220;Coffee? Milk?&#8221; was like a challenge.
Whatever the individual&#8217;s choice might be, he got
it in a torrent in his stone-china cup.</p>
<p>There was no attempt at conversation, and only
the clatter and rattle of knives, forks, and dishes
was heard until a laugh from an adjoining room
broke the silence&mdash;a laugh that was mirthless, shrill,
and horrible.</p>
<p>McArthur sent a startled glance of inquiry about
the table. The laugh was repeated, and the sound
was even more wild and maniacal. The little man
was shocked at the grin which he noted upon each
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;She ought to take a feather and ile her voice,&#8221;
observed a guest known as &#8220;Meeteetse Ed.&#8221;</p>
<p>McArthur could not resist saying indignantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;The unfortunate are to be pitied, my dear sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is jest a mild spasm she&#8217;s havin&#8217; now.
You ought to hear her when she&#8217;s warmed up.&#8221;</p>
<p>McArthur was about to administer a sharper
rebuke when the door opened and Susie came out.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that for a screech?&#8221; she demanded
triumphantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d sure make a bunch of coyotes take fer
home,&#8221; Meeteetse Ed replied flatteringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have come in my way not once or twice,
but thrice; and now you die! Ha! Ha!&#8221; Reaching
for a spoon, Susie stabbed Meeteetse Ed on
the second china button of his flannel shirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather die than have you laff in my ear
like that,&#8221; declared Meeteetse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to learn a comical piece.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any of &#8217;em&#8217;s comical enough,&#8221; replied a husky
voice from the far end of the table. &#8220;I broke
somethin&#8217; inside of me laffin&#8217; at that one about
your dyin&#8217; child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; Susie answered, unabashed by
criticism. &#8220;Teacher says I&#8217;ve got quite a strain
of pathos in me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to do somethin&#8217; for it,&#8221; suggested
a new voice. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you bile up some Oregon
grape-root? That&#8217;ll take most anything out of
your blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or go to Warm Springs and get your head
examined.&#8221; This voice was Smith&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could they help <i>you</i> any?&#8221; The girl&#8217;s eyes
narrowed and there was nothing of the previous
good-natured banter in her shrill tones.</p>
<p>Smith flushed under the shout of mocking laughter
which followed. He tried to join in it, but
the glitter of his blue eyes betrayed his anger.</p>
<p>The incident sobered the table-full, and silence
fell once more, until McArthur, feeling that an
effort toward conversation was a duty he owed his
hostess, cleared his throat and inquired pleasantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Have any fragments ever been found in that
red formation which I observed to the left of us,
which would indicate that this vicinity was once the
home of the mammoth dinosaur?&#8221;</p>
<p>Too late he realized that the question was ill-advised.
As might be expected, it was Tubbs who
broke the awkward silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t look to me, as I rid along, that it
ever were the home of anybuddy. A homestid&#8217;s no
good if you can&#8217;t git water on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>McArthur hesitated, then explained: &#8220;The
dinosaur was a prehistoric reptile,&#8221; adding modestly,
&#8220;I once had the pleasure of helping to
restore an armored dinosaur.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If ever I gits a rope on one of them things,
I&#8217;ll box him up and ship him on to you,&#8221; said
Tubbs generously. Then he inquired as an afterthought:
&#8220;Would he snap or chaw me up
a-tall?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a prehysteric reptile?&#8221; interrupted
Susie.</p>
<p>&#8220;This particular reptile was a big snake, with
feet, that lived here when this country was a
marsh,&#8221; McArthur explained simply, for Susie&#8217;s
benefit.</p>
<p>The guests exchanged incredulous glances, but
it was Meeteetse Ed who laughed explosively and
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mister, they ain&#8217;t been a sixteenth of
an inch of standin&#8217; water on this hull reserve in
twenty year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better haul in your horns, feller, when you&#8217;re
talkin&#8217; to a real prairie man.&#8221; Smith&#8217;s contemptuous
tone nettled McArthur, but Susie retorted
for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feller,&#8221; mocked Susie, &#8220;looks like you&#8217;re
mixed. You mean when he&#8217;s talkin&#8217; to a Yellow-back.
No real prairie man packs a chip on his
shoulder all the time. That buttermilk you was
raised on back there in Missoury has soured you
some.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again an angry flush betrayed Smith&#8217;s feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;A Yellow-back,&#8221; Susie explained with gusto in
response to McArthur&#8217;s puzzled look, &#8220;is one of
these ducks that reads books with buckskin-colored
covers, until he gets to thinkin&#8217; that he&#8217;s a Bad
Man himself. This here country is all tunnelled
over with the graves of Yellow-backs what couldn&#8217;t
make their bluffs stick; fellers that just knew
enough to start rows and couldn&#8217;t see &#8217;em
through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Generally,&#8221; said Smith evenly, as he stared
unblinkingly into Susie&#8217;s eyes, &#8220;when I starts
rows, I sees &#8217;em through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And any time,&#8221; Susie answered, staring back
at him, &#8220;that you start a row on <i>this</i> ranch,
you&#8217;ve <i>got</i> to see it through.&#8221;</p>
<p>The grub-liners raised their eyes in surprise, for
there was unmistakable ill-feeling in her voice. It
was unlike her, this antagonistic attitude toward
a stranger, for, as they all knew, her hospitality
was unlimited, and every passer-by whose horse
fed at the big hayrack was regarded and treated as
a welcome friend.</p>
<p>There was rarely malice behind the sharp personalities
which she flung at random about the
table. Knowing no social distinctions, Susie was
no respecter of persons. She chaffed and flouted
the man who wintered a thousand head of cattle
with the same impartiality with which she gibed
his blushing cowpuncher. Her good-nature was a
byword, as were her generosity and boyish daring.
Susie MacDonald was a local celebrity in
her way, and on the big hay-ranch her lightest
word was law.</p>
<p>But the mere presence of this new-comer seemed
to fill her with resentment, making of her an irrepressible
young shrew who gloated openly in his
angry confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speakin&#8217; of Yellow-backs,&#8221; said Meeteetse, with
the candid intent of being tactful, &#8220;reminds me
of a song a pardner of mine wrote up about &#8217;em
once. Comical? <i>T&#8217;&mdash;t&#8217;&mdash;t&#8217;&mdash;!</i>&#8221; He wagged his
head as if he had no words in which to describe
its incomparable humor. &#8220;He had another song
that was a reg&#8217;lar tear-starter: &#8216;Whar the Silver
Colorady Wends Its Way.&#8217; Ever hear it? It&#8217;s
about a feller that buried his wife by the silver
Colorady, and turned outlaw. This pardner of
mine used to beller every time he sung it. He
cried like he was a Mormon, and he hadn&#8217;t no
more wife than a jack rabbit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some songs is touchin&#8217;,&#8221; agreed Arkansaw
Red.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was,&#8221; declared Meeteetse. &#8220;How she
faded day by day, till a pale, white corp&#8217; she lay!
If I hadn&#8217;t got this cold on me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to see you sufferin&#8217;, Meeteetse, but if it
keeps you from warblin&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He ignored Susie&#8217;s implication, and went on
serenely:</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like it&#8217;s settled on me for life, and it
all comes of tryin&#8217; not to be a hog.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it&#8217;ll be a lesson to you,&#8221; said Susie
soberly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That there Bar C cowpuncher, Babe, comes
over the other night, and, the bunk-house bein&#8217;
full, I offers him half my blankets. I never put
in such a night since I froze to death on South
Pass. For fair, I&#8217;d ruther sleep with a two-year-ole
steer&mdash;couldn&#8217;t kick no worse than that Babe.
Why them blankets was in the air more&#8217;n half the
time, with him pullin&#8217; his way, and me snatchin&#8217;
of &#8217;em back. Finally I gits a corner of a soogan
in my teeth, and that way I manages a little sleep.
I vows I&#8217;d ruther be a hog and git a night&#8217;s rest
than take in such a turrible bed-feller as him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apropos of the restless Babe, one James Padden
observed: &#8220;They say he&#8217;s licked more&#8217;n half the
Bar C outfit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lick &#8217;em!&#8221; exclaimed Meeteetse, with enthusiasm.
&#8220;Why, he could eat &#8217;em! He jest tapped
me an easy one and nigh busted my jaw. If he
ever reely hit you with that fist of his&#8217;n, it ud sink
in up to the elbow. I ast him once: &#8217;Babe,&#8217; I
says, &#8216;how big are you anyhow?&#8217; &#8216;Big?&#8217; he
says surprised. &#8216;I ain&#8217;t big. I&#8217;m the runt of the
family. Pa was thirty-two inches between the eyes,
and they fed him with a shovel.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie giggled at some thought, and then inquired:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did anybody ever see that horse he&#8217;s huntin&#8217;?
He says it&#8217;s a two-year-old filly that he thinks
the world of. It&#8217;s brown, with a star in its forehead,
and one hip is knocked down. He never
hunts anywhere except on that road past the
school-house, and he stops at the pump each way&mdash;goin&#8217;
and comin&#8217;. I never saw anybody with such
a thirst. He looks in the window while he&#8217;s drinkin&#8217;,
and swallows a gallon of water at a time, and
don&#8217;t know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Love is a turrible disease.&#8221; Tubbs spoke with
the emphasis of conviction. &#8220;It&#8217;s worse&#8217;n lump-jaw
er blackleg. It&#8217;s dum nigh as bad as glanders.
It&#8217;s ketchin&#8217;, too, and I holds that anybody that&#8217;s
got it bad ought to be dipped and quarantined.
I knowed a feller over in Judith Basin what suffered
agonies with it for two months, then shot
hisself. There was seven of &#8217;em tyin&#8217; their horses
to the same Schoolmarm&#8217;s hitchin&#8217;-post.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take a long-geared Schoolmarm in a woolly
Tam-o&#8217;-shanter, and she&#8217;s a reg&#8217;lar storm-centre,&#8221;
vouchsafed the husky voice of &#8220;Banjo&#8221; Johnson.</p>
<p>&#8220;They is! They is!&#8221; declared Meeteetse, with
more feeling than the occasion seemed to warrant.</p>
<p>The knob of a door adjoining the dining-room
turned, and the grub-liners straightened in their
chairs. Susie&#8217;s eyes danced with mischief as she
leaned toward Meeteetse and asked innocently:</p>
<p>&#8220;They is <i>what</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>But with the opening of the door the voluble
Meeteetse seemed to be stricken dumb.</p>
<p>As a young woman came out, Smith stared, and
instinctively McArthur half rose from his chair.
Believing his employer contemplated flight, Tubbs
laid a restraining hand upon his coat-tail, while
inadvertently he turned his knife in his mouth with
painful results.</p>
<p>The young woman who seated herself in one of
the two unoccupied chairs was not of the far West.
Her complexion alone testified to this fact, for
the fineness and whiteness of it were conspicuous
in a country where the winter&#8217;s wind and burning
suns of summer tan the skins of men and women
alike until they resemble leather in color and in
texture. Had this young woman possessed no
other good feature, her markedly fine complexion
alone would have saved her from plainness. But
her thick brown hair, glossy, and growing prettily
about her temples, was equally attractive to the
men who had been used to seeing only the straight,
black hair of the Indian women, and Susie&#8217;s sun-bleached
pigtail, which, as Meeteetse took frequent
occasion to remind her, looked like a hair-cinch.
Her eyes, set rather too far apart for beauty,
were round, with pupils which dilated until they
all but covered the blue iris; the eyes of an emotional
nature, an imaginative mind. Her other
features, though delicate, were not exceptional, but
the <i>tout ensemble</i> was such that her looks would
have been considered above the average even in a
country where pretty girls were plentiful. In her
present surroundings, and by contrast with the
womenfolk about her, she was regarded as the
most beautiful of her sex. Her manner, reserved
to the point of stiffness, and paralyzing, as it
did, the glibbest masculine tongue among them, was
also looked upon as the acme of perfection and
all that was desirable in young ladyhood; each
individual humbly admitting that while he never
before had met a real lady, he knew one when he
saw her.</p>
<p>The young woman returned McArthur&#8217;s bow
with a friendly smile, his action having at once
placed him as being &#8220;different.&#8221; Noting the fact,
the grub-liners resolved not to be outdone in
future in a mere matter of bows.</p>
<p>While nearly every arm was outstretched with an
offer of food, Susie leaned forward and whispered
ostentatiously behind her hand to Smith:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you make any cracks. That&#8217;s the
Schoolmarm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been around the world some,&#8221; Smith replied
curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The south side of Billings ain&#8217;t the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was only a random shot, as she did not know
Billings or any other town save by hearsay, but
it made a bull&#8217;s-eye. Susie knew it by the startled
look which she surprised from him, and Smith
could have throttled her as she snickered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mister McArthur and Mister Tubbs, I&#8217;ll make
you acquainted with Miss Marshall.&#8221;</p>
<p>With elaborate formality of tone and manner,
Susie pointed at each individual with her fork while
mentioning them by name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Marshall,&#8221; McArthur murmured, again
half rising.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much obliged to meet you,&#8221; said Tubbs
heartily as, bowing in imitation of his employer,
he caught the edge of his plate on the band of
his trousers and upset it.</p>
<p>Everybody stopped eating during this important
ceremony, and now all looked at Smith to
see what form his acknowledgment of the coveted
introduction to the Schoolmarm would take.</p>
<p>Smith in turn looked expectantly at Susie, who
met his eyes with a mocking grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything I can reach for you, Mister Smith?&#8221;
she inquired. &#8220;Looks like you&#8217;re waitin&#8217; for something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s face and the red table-cloth were much
the same shade as he looked annihilation at the
little half-breed imp.</p>
<p>Each time that Dora Marshall raised her eyes,
they met those of Smith. There was nothing of
impertinence in his stare; it was more of awe&mdash;a
kind of fascinated wonder&mdash;and she found herself
speculating as to who and what he was. He
was not a regular &#8220;grub-liner,&#8221; she was sure
of that, for he was as different in his way as
McArthur. He had a personality, not exactly
pleasant, but unique. Though he was not uncommonly
tall, his shoulders were thick and broad,
giving the impression of great strength. His jaw
was square, but it evidenced brutality rather than
determination. His nose, in contrast to the intelligence
denoted by his high, broad forehead, was
mediocre, inconsequential, the kind of a nose seldom
seen on the person who achieves. The two features
were those of the man who conceives big things,
yet lacks the force to execute them.</p>
<p>His eyes were unpleasantly bloodshot, but
whether from drink or the alkali dust of the desert,
it was impossible to determine; and when Susie
prodded him they had in them all the vicious meanness
of an outlaw bronco. His expression then
held nothing but sullen vindictiveness, while every
trait of a surly nature was suggested by his voice
and manner.</p>
<p>During the Schoolmarm&#8217;s covert study of him,
he laughed unexpectedly at one of Meeteetse Ed&#8217;s
sallies. The effect was little short of marvellous;
it completely transformed him. An unlooked-for
dimple deepened in one cheek, his eyes sparkled,
his entire countenance radiated for a moment a
kind of boyish good-nature which was indescribably
winning. In the brief space, whatever virtues he
possessed were as vividly depicted upon his face
as were his unpleasant characteristics when he was
displeased. So marked, indeed, was his changed
expression, that Susie burst out with her usual
candor as she eyed him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mister, you ought to laugh all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Contributing but little toward the conversation,
and that little chiefly in the nature of flings at
Susie, Smith was yet the dominant figure at the
table. While he antagonized, he interested, and
although his insolence was no match for Susie&#8217;s
self-assured impudence, he still impressed his individuality
upon every person present.</p>
<p>He was studied by other eyes than Dora&#8217;s and
Susie&#8217;s. Not one of the looks which he had given
the former had escaped the Indian woman. With
the Schoolmarm&#8217;s coming, she had seen herself ignored,
and her face had grown as sullen as Smith&#8217;s
own, while the smouldering glow in her dark eyes
betrayed jealous resentment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a cookie?&#8221; urged Susie hospitably,
thrusting a plate toward Tubbs. &#8220;Ling makes
these &#8217;specially for White Antelope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thanks, I&#8217;ve et hearty,&#8221; declared Tubbs,
while McArthur shuddered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had thousands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, where is White Antelope?&#8221; Susie looked
in surprise at the vacant chair, and asked the
question of her mother.</p>
<p>Involuntarily Smith&#8217;s eyes and those of the
Indian woman met. He read correctly all that
they contained, but he did not remove his own
until her eyelids slowly dropped, and with a peculiar
doggedness she drawled:</p>
<p>&#8220;He go way for l&#8217;il visit; &#8217;bout two, t&#8217;ree sleeps
maybe.&#8221;</p>

<h3>A SWAP IN SADDLE BLANKETS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Madam,&#8221; said McArthur, intercepting the
Indian woman the next morning while she was on
her way from the spring with a heavy pail, &#8220;I
cannot permit you to carry water when I am
here to do it for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of her surprised protest, he gently took
the bucket from her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at that dude,&#8221; said Smith contemptuously,
viewing the incident through the living-room
window. &#8220;Queerin&#8217; hisself right along. No
more <i>sabe</i> than a cotton-tail rabbit. That&#8217;s the
worse thing he could do. Feller&#8221;&mdash;turning to
Tubbs&mdash;&#8220;if you want to make a winnin&#8217; with a
woman, you never want to fetch and carry for
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knows it,&#8221; acquiesced Tubbs. &#8220;Onct I was
a reg&#8217;lar doormat fer one, and I only got stomped
on fer it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can wrangle Injuns to a fare-ye-well,&#8221; Smith
continued. &#8220;Over on the Blackfoot I was the
most notorious Injun wrangler that ever jumped
up; and, feller, on the square, I never run an
errant for one in my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wrong,&#8221; agreed Tubbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s that dude tryin&#8217; to make a stand-in,
and spilin&#8217; his own game all the time by talkin&#8217;.
You can&#8217;t say he talks, neither; he just opens
his mouth and lets it say what it damn pleases.
Is them real words he gets off, or does he make
&#8217;em up as he goes along?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Search me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tip you off, feller: if ever you want to
make a strong play at an Injun woman, you don&#8217;t
want to shoot off your mouth none. Keep still
and move around just so, and pretty soon she&#8217;ll
throw you the sign. Did you ever notice a dog
trottin&#8217; down the street, passin&#8217; everybody up till
all to once it takes a sniff, turns around, and
follers some feller off? That&#8217;s an Injun woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never had no luck with squaws, and the likes
o&#8217; that,&#8221; Tubbs confessed. &#8220;They&#8217;re turrible
hands to git off together and poke fun at you.&#8221;</p>
<p>As McArthur and the Indian woman came in
from the kitchen, he was saying earnestly to her:</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel sure that here, madam, I should entirely
recover my health. Besides, this locality seems
to me such a fertile field for research that if you
could possibly accommodate my man and me with
board, you may not be conferring a favor only
upon me, but indirectly, perhaps, upon the world
of science. I have with me my own bath-tub and
pneumatic mattress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tubbs, seeing the Indian woman&#8217;s puzzled expression,
explained:</p>
<p>&#8220;He means we&#8217;ll sleep ourselves if you will eat
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you can stay. I no care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith frowned; but McArthur, much pleased
by her assent, told Tubbs to saddle a horse at
once, that he might lose no time in beginning his
investigations.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it were my good fortune to unearth a
cranium of the Homo primogenus, I should be the
happiest man in the world,&#8221; declared McArthur,
clasping his fingers in ecstasy at the thought of
such unparalleled bliss.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I tell you?&#8221; said Smith, accompanying
Tubbs to the corral. &#8220;He&#8217;s tryin&#8217; to win
himself a home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks that way,&#8221; Tubbs agreed. &#8220;These here
bug-hunters is deep.&#8221;</p>
<p>The saddle blanket which Tubbs pulled from
their wagon and threw upon the ground, with
McArthur&#8217;s saddle, caught Smith&#8217;s eye instantly,
because of the similarity in color and markings to
that which he had folded so carefully inside his
own. This was newer, it had no disfiguring holes,
or black stain in the corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of takin&#8217; chances?&#8221; he asked
himself as he looked it over.</p>
<p>While Tubbs was catching the horse in the corral,
Smith deftly exchanged blankets, and Tubbs,
to whom most saddle blankets looked alike, did not
detect the difference.</p>
<p>Upon returning to the house, Smith found the
Indian woman wiping breakfast dishes for the
cook. She came into the living-room when he
beckoned to her, with the towel in her hand. Taking
it from her, he wadded it up and threw it back
into the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know any better not to spoil a
cook like that, woman?&#8221; he asked, smiling down
upon her. &#8220;You never want to touch a dish for
a cook. Row with &#8217;em, work &#8217;em over, keep &#8217;em
down&mdash;but don&#8217;t humor &#8217;em. You can&#8217;t treat a
cook like a real man. Ev&#8217;ry reg&#8217;lar cook has
a screw loose or he wouldn&#8217;t be a cook. Cookin&#8217;
ain&#8217;t no man&#8217;s job. I never had no use for reg&#8217;lar
cooks&mdash;me, Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;All you women need ribbing up once in awhile,&#8221;
he added, as, laying his hand lightly on her arm,
he let it slide its length until it touched her fingers.
He gave them a gentle pressure and resumed his
seat against the wall.</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s eyes glowed as she looked at him.
His authoritative attitude appealed to her whose
ancestors had dressed game, tanned hides, and
dragged wood for their masters for countless generations.
The growing passion in her eyes did
not escape Smith.</p>
<p>In the long silence which followed he looked at
her steadily; finally he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;ll saddle up. You look &#8216;just
so&#8217; to me, woman&mdash;but I got to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laid down the rags of her mat and &#8220;threw
him the sign&#8221; for which he had waited. It said:</p>
<p>&#8220;My heart is high; it is good toward you. Talk
to me&mdash;talk straight.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Singing Bird; I am headed for the
Mexican border&mdash;many, many sleeps from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>She arose and walked to his side.</p>
<p>He felt a sudden and violent dislike for her
flabby, swaying hips, her heavy step, as she moved
toward him. He knew that the game was won,
and won so easily it was a school-boy&#8217;s play.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why you go?&#8221; she demanded, and the disappointment
in her eyes was so intense as to resemble
fear. &#8220;What you do dere?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her through half-closed eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear of wet horses?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I deals in wet horses&mdash;me, Smith.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman stared at him uncomprehendingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Down there on the border,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;you
buy the horses on the Mexico side. You buy &#8217;em
when the Mexican boss is asleep in his &#8217;dobe, so
there&#8217;s no kick about the price. You swim &#8217;em
across the Rio Grande and sell &#8217;em to the Americano
waitin&#8217; on the other side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You buy de wet horse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, by Gawd,&mdash;I wet &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why you steal?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why does anybody steal? I need the dinero&mdash;me,
Smith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want money?&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always want money. I never had enough
but once in my life, and then I had too much.
Gold is hell to pack,&#8221; he added reminiscently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have de fine hay-ranch, white man, de best
on de reservation. Two, four t&#8217;ousand dollars I
have when de hay is sold. De ranch is big&#8221;&mdash;her
arms swept the horizon to show its extent.
&#8220;You stay here and make de bargain with de
cattlemen, and I give you so much&#8221;&mdash;she measured
a third of her hand with her forefinger.
&#8220;If dat is not enough, I give you so much&#8221;&mdash;she
measured the half of her hand with her forefinger.
&#8220;If dat not enough, I give you all.&#8221; She swept
the palm of one hand with the other.</p>
<p>Smith dropped his eyelids, that she might not see
the triumph shining beneath them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must think, Prairie Flower.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, white man, you no think. You stay!&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith, who had arisen, slipped his arm about her
ample waist. She pulled aside his Mackinaw coat
and laid her head upon his breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;The white man&#8217;s heart is strong,&#8221; she said
softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It beats for you, Little Fawn;&#8221; and he ran
out his tongue in derision.</p>
<p>All the morning she sat on the floor at his
feet, braiding the rags for her mat, content to
hear him speak occasionally, and to look often into
his face with dog-like devotion. It was there Susie
saw her when she returned from school earlier in
the afternoon than usual, and was beckoned into
the kitchen by Ling.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s makin&#8217; a mash,&#8221; said Ling laconically,
as he jerked his thumb toward the open door of
the living-room.</p>
<p>All the girlish vivacity seemed to go out of
Susie&#8217;s face in her first swift glance. It hardened
in mingled shame and anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; she said sharply, &#8220;you promised me
that you wouldn&#8217;t sit on the floor like an Injun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re gettin&#8217; sociable,&#8221; said Smith mockingly.</p>
<p>The woman glanced at Smith, and hesitated,
but finally got up and seated herself on the bench.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you try bein&#8217; &#8217;sociable&#8217; with the
Schoolmarm?&#8221; Susie sneered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And <i>maybe</i> you won&#8217;t get passed up like a
white chip!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I dunno. I&#8217;ve made some winnings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can tell that by your eyes. You got &#8217;em
bloodshot, I reckon, hangin&#8217; over the fire in squaw
camps. White men can&#8217;t stand smoke like Injuns.&#8221;</p>
<p>This needle-tongued girl jabbed the truth into
him in a way which maddened him, but he said
conciliatingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to quarrel, kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean <i>you</i> don&#8217;t.&#8221; Susie slammed the
door behind her.</p>
<p>The child&#8217;s taunt reawakened his interest in the
Schoolmarm. He thought of her riding home
alone, and grew restless. Besides, the dulness began
to bore him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll saddle up, Prairie Flower, and look over
the ranch. When I come back I&#8217;ll let you know
if it&#8217;s worth my while to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tubbs was sitting on the wagon-tongue, mending
harness, when Smith went out,</p>
<p>&#8220;Aimin&#8217; to quit the flat?&#8221; inquired Tubbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feller, didn&#8217;t that habit of askin&#8217; questions
ever git you in trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well I guess <i>so</i>,&#8221; Tubbs replied candidly.
&#8220;See that scar under my eye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d invite you along to tell me about it,&#8221; said
Smith sardonically, &#8220;only, the fact is, feller, I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; down the road to make medicine with the
Schoolmarm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tubbs&#8217;s eyes widened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh!&#8221; he ejaculated enviously. &#8220;I wisht I
had your gall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Smith swung into the saddle he pulled
out a heavy silver watch attached to a hair watch-chain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the right time,&#8221; he nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, if it was only two o&#8217;clock, or three, I
wouldn&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t? I&#8217;ll tell you about me: I&#8217;d
go if it was twelve o&#8217;clock at night and twenty
below zero to ride home with that lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Feller,&#8221; said Smith, in a paternal tone, &#8220;you
never want to make a break at a woman before four
o&#8217;clock in the afternoon. You might just as well
go and lay down under a bush in the shade from
a little after daylight until about this time. You
wouldn&#8217;t hunt deer or elk in the middle of the
day, would you? No, nor women&mdash;all same kind
of huntin&#8217;. They&#8217;ll turn you down sure; white or
red&mdash;no difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; said Tubbs, in the awed voice
of one who sits at the feet of a master.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the moon&#8217;s out and the lamps are lit,
they&#8217;ll empty their sack and tell you the story of
their lives. I don&#8217;t want to toot my horn none, but
I&#8217;ve wrangled around some. I&#8217;ve hunted big game
and humans. Their habits, feller, is much the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Smith was galloping down the road
toward the school-house, Susie was returning from
a survey of the surrounding country, which was to
be had from a knoll near the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; she said abruptly, &#8220;I feel queer
here.&#8221; She laid both hands on her flat, childish
breast and hunched her shoulders. &#8220;I feel like
something is goin&#8217; to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happen, you think?&#8221; her mother asked
listlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something about White Antelope, I
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman looked up quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He go visit Bear Chief, maybe.&#8221; There was
an odd note in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t go away and stay like this without
telling you or me. He never did before. He
knows I would worry; besides, he didn&#8217;t take a
horse, and he never would walk ten miles when
there are horses to ride. His gun isn&#8217;t here, so he
must have gone hunting, but he wouldn&#8217;t stay all
night hunting rabbits; and he couldn&#8217;t be lost,
when he knows the country as well as you or me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He go to visit,&#8221; the Indian woman insisted
doggedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he isn&#8217;t home to-morrow, I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to hunt
him, but I know something&#8217;s wrong.&#8221;</p>

<h3>SMITH MAKES MEDICINE WITH THE SCHOOLMARM</h3>
</div>

<p>Once out of sight of the house, Smith let
his horse take its own gait, while he viewed the
surrounding country with the thoughtful consideration
of a prospective purchaser. As he gazed,
its possibilities grew upon him. If water was to
be found somewhere in the Bad Lands the location
of the ranch was ideal for&mdash;certain purposes.</p>
<p>The Bar C cattle-range bounded the reservation
on the west; the MacDonald ranch, as it was
still called, after the astute Scotch squawman who
had built it, was close to the reservation line; and
beyond the sheltering Bad Lands to the northeast
was a ranch where lived certain friendly persons
with whom he had had most satisfactory business
relations in the past.</p>
<p>A plan began to take definite shape in his active
brain, but the head of a sleepy white pony appearing
above the next rise temporarily changed the
course of his thoughts, and with his recognition
of its rider life took on an added zest.</p>
<p>Dora Marshall, engrossed in thought, did not
see Smith until he pulled his hat-brim in salutation
and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a thinker, I take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I find my work here absorbing,&#8221; she replied,
coloring under his steady look.</p>
<p>He turned his horse and swung it into the road
beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just millin&#8217; around and thought I&#8217;d
ride down the road and meet you.&#8221; Further than
this brief explanation, he did not seem to feel
it incumbent upon him to make conversation.
Apparently entirely at his ease in the silence which
followed, he turned his head often and stared at
her with a frank interest which he made no effort
to conceal. Finally he shifted his weight to one
stirrup and, turning in his saddle so that he faced
her, he asked bluntly:</p>
<p>&#8220;That look in your eyes&mdash;that look as if you
hadn&#8217;t nothin&#8217; to hide&mdash;is it true? Is it natural,
as you might say, or do you just put it on?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her astonished expression led him to explain.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like lookin&#8217; down deep into water that&#8217;s
so clear you can see the sand shinin&#8217; in the bottom;
one of these places where there&#8217;s no mud or black
spots; nothin&#8217; you can&#8217;t see or understand. <i>Sabe</i>
what I mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Since she did not answer, he continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve met up with women before now that had
that same look, but only at first. It didn&#8217;t last;
they could put it on and take it off like they did
their hats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I am quite sure what you
mean,&#8221; the girl replied, embarrassed by the personal
nature of his questions and comments; &#8220;but
if you mean to imply that I affect this or that
expression, for a purpose, you misjudge me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just askin&#8217;,&#8221; said Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I am always honest of purpose,&#8221; the
girl went on slowly, &#8220;and when one is that, I
think it shows in one&#8217;s eyes. To be sure, I often
fall short of my intentions. I mean to do right,
and almost as frequently do wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do?&#8221; He eyed her with quick intentness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, don&#8217;t you? Don&#8217;t all of us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I does what I aims to do,&#8221; he replied ambiguously.</p>
<p>So she&mdash;this girl with eyes like two deep springs&mdash;did
wrong&mdash;frequently. He pondered the admission
for a long time. Smith&#8217;s exact ideas of
right and wrong would have been difficult to define;
the dividing line, if there were any, was so vague
that it had never served as the slightest restraint.
&#8220;To do what you aim to do, and make a clean
get-away&#8221;&mdash;that was the successful life.</p>
<p>He had seen things, it is true; there had been
incidents and situations which had repelled him,
but why, he had never asked himself. There was
one situation in particular to which his mind frequently
reverted, as it did now. He had known
worse women than the one who had figured in it,
but for some reason this single scene was impressed
upon his mind with a vividness which seemed never
to grow less.</p>
<p>He saw a woman seated at an old-fashioned
organ in a country parlor. There was a rag-carpet
on the floor&mdash;he remembered how springy
it was with the freshly laid straw underneath it.
Her husband held a lamp that she might see the
notes, while his other hand was upon her shoulder,
his adoring eyes upon her silly face. He, Smith, was
rocking in the blue plush chair for which the fool
with the calloused hands had done extra work that
he might give it to the woman upon her birthday.
Each time that she screeched the refrain, &#8220;Love,
I will love you always,&#8221; she lifted her chin to
sing it to the man beaming down upon her, while
upstairs her trunk was packed to desert him.</p>
<p>Smith always remembered with satisfaction that
he had left her in Red Lodge with only the price
of a telegram to her husband, in her shabby purse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like your style, girl.&#8221; His eyes swept Dora
Marshall&#8217;s figure as he spoke.</p>
<p>There was a difference in his tone, a familiarity
in his glance, which sent the color flying to the
Schoolmarm&#8217;s cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we could hit it off&mdash;you and me&mdash;if we
got sociable.&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaned toward her and laid his gloved hand
upon hers as it rested on the saddle-horn.</p>
<p>The pupils of her eyes dilated until they all but
covered the iris as she turned them, blazing, upon
Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what do you mean by that?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the genuineness nor the
nature of the emotion which made her voice vibrate.
But Smith considered. Was she deeper&mdash;&#8220;slicker,&#8221;
as he phrased it to himself&mdash;than he had thought,
or had he really misunderstood her? Surprising as
was the feeling, he hoped some way, that it was
the latter. He looked at her again before he
answered gently:</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to make you hot none, Miss.
I&#8217;m ignorant in handlin&#8217; words. I only meant to
say that I hoped you and me would be good
friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>His explanation cleared her face instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry if I misunderstood you; but one
or two unpleasant experiences in this country have
made me quick&mdash;too quick, perhaps&mdash;to take
offense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s lots just lookin&#8217; for game like you.
No better nor brutes,&#8221; said Smith virtuously, entirely
sincere in his sudden indignation against
these licentious characters.</p>
<p>Yes, the Schoolmarm had rebuffed him, as Susie
had prophesied, but the effect of it upon him was
such as neither he nor she had reckoned. As they
rode along a swift, overpowering infatuation for
Dora Marshall grew upon him. He felt something
like a flame rising within him, burning him, bewildering
him with its intensity. She seemed all at
once to possess every attribute of the angels,
from mere prettiness her face took on a radiant
beauty which dazzled him, and when she spoke her
lightest word held him breathless. As the mountain
towers above the foothills, so, of a sudden,
she towered above all other women. He had known
sensations&mdash;all, he had believed, that it was possible
to experience; but this one, strange, overwhelming,
dazed him with its violence.</p>
<p>Love frequently comes like this to people in
the wilds, to those who have few interests and
much time to think. The emotional side of their
natures has been held in check until a trifle is
sometimes sufficient to loose a torrent which nothing
can then divert or check.</p>
<p>She asked him to loop her latigo, which was
trailing, and his hand shook as he fumbled with
the leather strap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gawd!&#8221; he swore in bewilderment as he returned
to his own horse, wiping his forehead with
the back of his gauntlet, &#8220;what feelin&#8217; is this
workin&#8217; on me? Am I gettin&#8217; locoed, me&mdash;Smith?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve found a friend like you,&#8221; said
the Schoolmarm impulsively. &#8220;One needs friends
in a country like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A friend!&#8221; It sounded like a jest to Smith.
&#8220;A friend!&#8221; he repeated with an odd laugh.
Then he raised his hand, as one takes an oath, and
whatever of whiteness was left in Smith&#8217;s soul
illumined his face as he added: &#8220;Yes, to a killin&#8217;
finish.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Smith had met Dora among many, the result
might have been the same in the end, but here,
in the isolation, she seemed from the first the centre
of everything, the alpha and omega of the universe,
and his passion for her was as great as though
it were the growth of many months instead of less
than twenty-four hours. The depth, the breadth,
of it could not quickly be determined, nor the
lengths to which it would take him. It was something
new to be reckoned with. To what extent
it would control him, neither Smith nor any one
else could have told. He knew only that it now
seemed the most real, the most sincere, the best
thing which had ever come into his life.</p>
<p>Dora Marshall knew nothing of men like Smith,
or of natures like those of the men of the mountains
and ranges, who paid her homage. Her
knowledge of life and people was drawn from
the limited experiences of a small, Middle West
town, together with a year at a Middle West co-ed
college, and as a result of the latter the Schoolmarm
cherished a fine belief in her worldly wisdom, whereas,
in a measure, her lack of it was one of her
charms. Susie, in her way, was wiser.</p>
<p>The Schoolmarm&#8217;s attitude toward her daily
life was the natural outcome of a romantic nature
and an imaginative mind. She saw herself as the
heroine of an absorbing story, the living of which
story she enjoyed to the utmost, while every incident
and every person contributed to its interest.
Quite unconsciously, with unintentional egotism,
the Schoolmarm had a way of standing off and
viewing herself, as it were, through the rosy glow
of romance. Yet she was not a complex character&mdash;this
Schoolmarm. She had no soaring ambitions,
though her ideals for herself and for
others were of the best. To do her duty, to help
those about her, to win and retain the liking of
her half-savage little pupils, were her chief desires.</p>
<p>She had her share of the vanity of her sex,
and of its natural liking for admiration and attention,
yet in the freedom of her unique environment
she never overstepped the bounds of the
proprieties as she knew them, or violated in the
slightest degree the conventionalities to which she
had been accustomed in her rather narrow home
life. It was this reserve which inspired awe in
the men with whom she came in contact, used
as they were to the greater camaraderie of Western
women.</p>
<p>In her unsophistication, her provincial innocence,
Dora Marshall was exactly the sort to misunderstand
and to be misunderstood, a combination sometimes
quite as dangerous in its results, and as
provocative of trouble, as the intrigues of a designing
woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you think I&#8217;m kind of a mounted
bum, a grub-liner, or something like that,&#8221; said
Smith after a time.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be frank, I <i>have</i> wondered who you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you? Have you, honest?&#8221; asked Smith
delightedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;you&#8217;re different, you know. I can&#8217;t explain
just how, but you are not like the others
who come and go at the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Smith replied with some irony; &#8220;I&#8217;m
not like that there Tubbs.&#8221; He added laconically,
&#8220;I&#8217;m no angel, me&mdash;Smith.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Schoolmarm laughed. Smith&#8217;s denial was
so obviously superfluous.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a time when I&#8217;d do &#8217;most any old
thing,&#8221; he went on, unmindful of her amusement.
&#8220;It was only a few years ago that there was no
law north of Cheyenne, and a feller got what he
wanted with his gun. I got my share. I come
from a country where they sleep between sheets, but
I got a lickin&#8217; that wasn&#8217;t comin&#8217; to me, and I
quit the flat when I was thirteen. I&#8217;ve been out
amongst &#8217;em since.&#8221;</p>
<p>The desire to reform somebody, which lies dormant
in every woman&#8217;s bosom, began to stir in
the Schoolmarm&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&mdash;you wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;do any old thing&#8217;
now, would you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith hesitated, and a variety of expressions
succeeded one another upon his face. It was an
awkward moment, for, under the uplifting influence
of the feeling which possessed him, he had an
odd desire to tell this girl only the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t do some of the things I used to
do,&#8221; he replied evasively.</p>
<p>The Schoolmarm beamed encouragement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to kill Injuns for fifty dollars a head,
but I wouldn&#8217;t do it now,&#8221; he said virtuously,
adding: &#8220;I&#8217;d get my neck stretched.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve killed people&mdash;Indians&mdash;for money!&#8221;
The Schoolmarm looked at him, wide-eyed with
horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;They was clutterin&#8217; up the range,&#8221; Smith explained
patiently, &#8220;and the cattlemen needed it
for their stock. I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; killed &#8217;em for nothin&#8217;,
but when &#8217;twas offered, I might as well get the
bounty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Schoolmarm scarcely knew what to say; his
explanation seemed so entirely satisfactory to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad those dreadful days have gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re gone all right,&#8221; Smith answered
sourly. &#8220;They make dum near as much fuss
over an Injun as a white man now, and what
with jumpin&#8217; up deputies at every turn in the
road, &#8217;tain&#8217;t safe. Why, I heard a judge say a
while back that killin&#8217; an Injun was pure murder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I appreciate your confidence&mdash;your telling me
of your life,&#8221; said the Schoolmarm, in lieu of something
better.</p>
<p>She found him a difficult person with whom to
converse. They seemed to have no common meeting-ground,
yet, while he constantly startled and
shocked, he also fascinated her. In one of those
illuminating flashes to which the Schoolmarm was
subject, she saw herself as Smith&#8217;s guiding-star,
leading him to the triumphant finish of the career
which she believed his unique but strong personality
made possible.</p>
<p>It was Smith&#8217;s turn to look at her. Did she
think he had told her of his life? The unexpected
dimple deepened in Smith&#8217;s cheek, and as he
laughed the Schoolmarm, again noting the effect
of it, could not in her heart believe that he was
as black as he had painted himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wisht our trails had crossed sooner, but,
anyhow, I&#8217;m on the square with you, girl. And
if ever you ketch me &#8217;talkin&#8217; crooked,&#8217; as the
Injuns say, I&#8217;ll give you my whole outfit&mdash;horse,
saddle, blankets, guns, even my dog-gone shirt.
Excuse me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Schoolmarm glowed. Her woman&#8217;s influence
for good was having its effect! This was
a step in the right direction&mdash;a long step. He
would be &#8220;on the square&#8221; with her&mdash;she liked
the way he phrased it. Already her mind was
busy with air-castles for Smith, which would have
made that person stare, had he known of them.
An inkling of their nature may be had from her
question:</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to study, to learn from books,
if you had the opportunity?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I learned my letters spellin&#8217; out the brands
on cattle,&#8221; he said frankly, &#8220;and that, with bein&#8217;
able to write my name on the business end of a
check, and common, everyday words, has always
been enough to see me through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But when one has naturally a good mind, like
yours, don&#8217;t you think it is almost wicked not to
use it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got a mind all right,&#8221; Smith replied complacently.
&#8220;I&#8217;m kind of a head-worker in my
way, but steady thinkin&#8217; makes me sicker nor a
pup. I got a headache for two days spellin&#8217; out
a description of myself that the sheriff of Choteau
County spread around the country on handbills.
It was plumb insultin&#8217;, as I figgered it out, callin&#8217;
attention to my eyes and ears and busted thumb.
I sent word to him that I felt hos-tile over it.
Sheriffs&#8217;ll go too far if you don&#8217;t tell &#8217;em where
to get off at once in awhile.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Schoolmarm ignored the handbill episode
and went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides, a lack of education is such a handicap
in business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The worst handicap I has to complain of,&#8221;
said Smith grimly, &#8220;is the habit people has got
into of sending money-orders through the mail,
instead of the cash. It keeps money out of circulation,
besides bein&#8217; discouragin&#8217; and puttin&#8217; many
a hard-workin&#8217; hold-up on the bum.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; she persisted, the real meaning of
Smith&#8217;s observations entirely escaping her, &#8220;even
the rudiments of an education would be such a
help to you, opening up many avenues that now
are closed to you. What I want to say is this:
that if you intend to stop for a time at the ranch,
I will be glad to teach you. Susie and I have an
extra session in the evening, and I will be delighted
to have you join us.&#8221;</p>
<p>It had not dawned upon Smith that she had
questioned him with this end in view. He looked
at her fixedly, then, from the depths of his experience,
he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl, you must like me some.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dora flushed hotly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am interested,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll do for now;&#8221; and Smith wondered if
the lump in his throat was going to choke him.
&#8220;Will I join that night-school of yours? <i>Will</i>
I? Watch me! Say,&#8221; he burst out with a kind
of boyish impulsiveness, &#8220;if ever you see me doin&#8217;
anything I oughtn&#8217;t, like settin&#8217; down when I
ought to stand up, or standin&#8217; up when I ought
to set down, will you just rope me and take a turn
around a snubbin&#8217;-post and jerk me off my feet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get along famously if you really want
to improve yourself!&#8221; exclaimed the Schoolmarm,
her eyes shining with enthusiasm. &#8220;If you really
and truly want to learn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really and truly I do,&#8221; Smith echoed, feeling
at the moment that he would have done dressmaking
or taken in washing, had she bid him.</p>
<p>Once more the world looked big, alluring, and
as full of untried possibilities as when he had
&#8220;quit the flat&#8221; at thirteen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you noticed me doin&#8217; anything that isn&#8217;t
manners?&#8221; he asked in humble anxiety. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
be afraid of hurtin&#8217; my feelin&#8217;s,&#8221; he urged, &#8220;for
I ain&#8217;t none.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you honestly want me to tell you things,
I will; but it seems so&mdash;so queer upon such a
very short acquaintance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks! What&#8217;s the use of wastin&#8217; time pretendin&#8217;
to get acquainted, when you&#8217;re acquainted
as soon as you look at each other? What&#8217;s the
use of sashayin&#8217; around the bush when you meet
up with somebody you like? You just cut loose
on me, girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a little thing, in a way, and not in
itself important perhaps; yet it would be, too, if
circumstances should take you into the world. It
might make a bad impression upon strangers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith looked slightly alarmed. He wondered
if she suspected anything about White Antelope.
At the moment, he could think of nothing else
he had done within the last twenty-four hours,
which might prejudice strangers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I noticed at the table,&#8221; the Schoolmarm went
on in some embarrassment, &#8220;that you held your
fork as though you were afraid it would get
away from you. Like this&#8221;&mdash;she illustrated with
her fist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like a ranch-hand holdin&#8217; onto a pitch-fork,&#8221;
Smith suggested, relieved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;It should be like
this. Anyway,&#8221; she declared encouragingly, &#8220;you
don&#8217;t eat with your knife.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith beamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you notice that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally, in a land of sword-swallowers, I
would;&#8221; the Schoolmarm made a wry face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once I run with a high-stepper from Bowlin&#8217;
Green, Kentucky, and she told me better nor that,&#8221;
he explained. &#8220;She said nothin&#8217; give a feller
away like his habit of handlin&#8217; tools at the table.
She was a lady all right, but she got the dope
habit and threw the lamp at me. The way I
quit her didn&#8217;t trouble <i>me</i>. None of &#8217;em ever
had any holt on me when it come to a show-down;
but you, girl, <i>you</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her sharp exclamation interrupted him, and,
following her gesture, he saw a flying horseman
in the distance, riding as for his life, while behind
him two other riders quirted their horses
in hot pursuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a race&mdash;for fun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it,&#8221; Smith replied dryly, noting
the direction from which they came. &#8220;It looks
like business.&#8221;</p>
<p>He knew that the two behind were Indians. He
could tell by the way they used their quirts and
sat their horses. Neither was there any mistaking
the bug-hunter on his ewe-necked sorrel, which,
displaying unexpected bursts of speed, was keeping
in the lead and heading straight for the ranch-house.
With one hand McArthur was clinging to
the saddle-horn, and with the other was clinging
quite as tightly to what at a distance appeared
to be a carbine.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s pulled his gun&mdash;why don&#8217;t he use it?&#8221;
Smith quickened his horse&#8217;s gait.</p>
<p>He knew that the Indians had learned White
Antelope&#8217;s fate. That was a lucky swap Smith
had made that morning. He congratulated himself
that he had not &#8220;taken chances.&#8221; He wondered
how effective McArthur&#8217;s denial would prove
in the face of the evidence furnished by the saddle-blanket.
Personally, Smith regarded the bug-hunter&#8217;s
chances as slim.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll get him in the corral,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s Mr. McArthur!&#8221; Dora cried in distress.</p>
<p>Smith looked at her in quick jealousy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what of it?&#8221; In her excitement, the
gruffness of his tone passed unobserved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; she urged. &#8220;The Indians are angry,
and he may need us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hatless, breathless, pale, McArthur rolled out
of his saddle and thrust a long, bleached bone into
Tubbs&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep it!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;Protect it! It may
be&mdash;I don&#8217;t say it is, but it <i>may</i> be&mdash;a portion
of the paroccipital bone of an Ichthyopterygian!&#8221;
Then he turned and faced his pursuers.</p>
<p>Infuriated, they rode straight at him, but he
did not flinch, and the horses swerved of their
own accord.</p>
<p>Susie had run from the house, and her mother
had followed, expectancy upon her stolid face, for,
like Smith, she had guessed the situation.</p>
<p>The Indians circled, and, returning, pointed
accusing fingers at McArthur.</p>
<p>&#8220;He kill White Antelope!&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time, the grub-liners had reached the
corral, among them four Indians, all friends of
the dead man. Their faces darkened.</p>
<p>&#8220;White Antelope is dead in a gulch!&#8221; cried
his accusers. &#8220;He is shot to pieces&mdash;here, there,
everywhere!&#8221;</p>
<p>A murmur of angry amazement arose. White
Antelope, the kindly, peaceable Cree, who had not
an enemy on the reservation!</p>
<p>&#8220;This is dreadful!&#8221; declared McArthur. &#8220;Believe
me&#8221;&mdash;he turned to them all&mdash;&#8220;I had but
found the corpse myself when these men rode up.
The Indian was cold; he certainly had been dead
for hours. Besides,&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;what possible
motive could I have?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Them as likes lettin&#8217; blood don&#8217;t need a motive.&#8221;
The sneering voice was Smith&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you, sir, met us on the hill. You know
the direction from which we came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s easy enough to circle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why should I go back?&#8221; cried McArthur.</p>
<p>&#8220;They say there&#8217;s that that draws folks back
for another look.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s insinuations, the stand he took, had its
effect upon the Indians, who, hot for revenge,
needed only this to confirm their suspicions. One
of the Indians on horseback began to uncoil his
rawhide saddle-rope. All save McArthur understood
the significance of the action. They meant to
tie him hand and foot and take him to the Agency,
with blows and insults plentiful en route.</p>
<p>They edged closer to him, every savage instinct
uppermost, their faces dark and menacing. McArthur,
his eyes sweeping the circle, felt that he
had not one friend, not one, in the motley,
threatening crowd fast closing in upon him; for
Tubbs, hearing himself indirectly included in the
accusation, had discreetly, and with perceptible
haste, withdrawn.</p>
<p>The Indian swung from his saddle, rope in
hand, and advanced upon McArthur with unmistakable
purpose; but he did not reach the little
scientist, for Susie darted from the circle, her
flashing gray eyes looking more curiously at
variance than ever with her tawny skin.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, Running Rabbit!&#8221; She pushed him
gently backward with her finger-tips upon his chest.</p>
<p>There was a murmur of protest from the crowd,
and it seemed to sting her like a spur. Susie was
not accustomed to disapproval. She turned to
where the murmurs came loudest&mdash;from the white
grub-liners, who were eager for excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;that you should be
so quick to accuse this stranger? You, Arkansaw
Red, that skipped from Kansas for killin&#8217; a nigger!
You, Jim Padden, that shot a sheep-herder in cold
blood! You, Banjo Johnson, that&#8217;s hidin&#8217; out this
minute! Don&#8217;t you all be so darned anxious to
hang another man, when there&#8217;s a rope waitin&#8217;
somewhere for your own necks!</p>
<p>&#8220;And lemme tell you&#8221;&mdash;she took a step toward
them. &#8220;The man that lifts a finger to take this
bug-hunter to the Agency can take his blankets
along at the same time, for there&#8217;ll never be a
bunk or a seat at the table for him on this ranch
as long as he lives. Where&#8217;s your proof against
this bug-hunter? You can&#8217;t drag a man off without
something against him&mdash;just because you want
to <i>hang</i> somebody!&#8221;</p>
<p>Some sound from Smith attracted her attention;
she wheeled upon him, and, with her thin arm outstretched
as she pointed at him in scorn, she cried
shrilly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;d sooner think <i>you</i> did it, than him!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was not so much as the flicker of an
eyelid from Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;d <i>sooner</i> think I did it than him,&#8221;
he said, playing upon the word. &#8220;You&#8217;d like to
see <i>me</i> get my neck stretched.&#8221;</p>
<p>His bravado, his very insolence, was his protection.</p>
<p>&#8220;And maybe I&#8217;ll have the chanst!&#8221; she retorted
furiously.</p>
<p>Turning from him to the Indians, her voice
dropped, the harsh language taking on the soft
accent of the squaws as she spoke to them in their
own tongue. Like many half-breeds, Susie seldom
admitted that she either understood or could speak
the Indian language. She had an amusing fashion
of referring even to her relatives as &#8220;those Injuns&#8221;;
but now, with hands outstretched, she
pleaded:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all Indians together in this&mdash;friends
of White Antelope! Our hearts are down; they
are heavy&mdash;so. You all know that he came from
the great Cree country with my father, and he
has told us many times stories of the big north
woods, where they hunted and trapped. You know
how he watched me when I was little, and sat with
his hand upon my head when I had the big fever.
He was like no one else to me except my father.
He was wise and good.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could kill with my own hand the man who
killed White Antelope. I want his blood as much
as you. I&#8217;d like to see a stake driven through his
black heart on White Antelope&#8217;s grave. But let us
not be too quick because the hate is hot in us. My
heart tells me that the white man talks straight. Let
us wait&mdash;wait until we find the right one, and when
we do we will punish in our own way. You hear?
<i>In our own way!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith understood something of her plea, and
for the second time he paid her courage tribute.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a game kid all right,&#8221; he said to himself,
and a half-formed plan for utilizing her gameness
began to take definite shape.</p>
<p>That she had won, he knew before Running Rabbit
recoiled his rope. After a moment&#8217;s talk among
themselves, the Indians went to hitch the horses
to the wagon, to bring White Antelope&#8217;s body
home.</p>
<p>Smith was well aware that he had only to point
to the saddle blanket, the barest edge of which
showed beneath the leather skirts of McArthur&#8217;s
saddle, to make Susie&#8217;s impassioned defense in vain.
Why he did not, he was not himself sure. Perhaps
it was because he liked the feeling of power,
of knowing that he held the life of the despised
bug-hunter in the hollow of his hand; or perhaps
it was because it would serve his purpose better
to make the accusation later. One thing was
certain, however, and that was that he had not
held his tongue through any consideration for
McArthur.</p>

<h2>VI</h2>
<h3>THE GREAT SECRET</h3>
</div>

<p>It was the day they buried White Antelope
that Smith approached Yellow Bird, a Piegan, who
was among the Indians paying visits of indefinite
length to the MacDonald ranch. &#8220;Eddie&#8221; Yellow
Bird, he was called at the Blackfoot mission
where he had learned to read and write&mdash;though
he would never have been suspected of these accomplishments,
since to all appearances he was a
&#8220;blanket Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith spoke the Piegan tongue almost as fluently
as his own, so he and Yellow Bird quickly
became <i>compadres</i>, relating to each other stories
of their prowess, of horses they had run off, of
cattle they had stolen, and hinting, Indian fashion,
with significant intonations and pauses, at crimes
of greater magnitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is your heart to-day, friend? Is it
strong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Weak,&#8221; replied Yellow Bird jestingly, touching
his breast with a fluttering hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be stronger if you had red meat in
your stomach,&#8221; Smith suggested significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bacon is not for Indians,&#8221; agreed Yellow
Bird.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the woman would have no cattle left if she
killed only her own beef.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people stop here&mdash;strangers and
friends,&#8221; Yellow Bird admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is plenty on the range.&#8221; Smith looked
toward the Bar C ranch.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a dog on the trail, that white man,
when his cattle are stolen,&#8221; Yellow Bird replied
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve killed dogs&mdash;me, Smith&mdash;when they got
in my way. Yellow Bird, are you a woman, that
you are afraid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wolf Robe, who stole only a calf, sits like
this&#8221;&mdash;Yellow Bird looked at Smith sullenly
through his spread fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have talked with the forked tongue, Yellow
Bird. You are not a Piegan buck of the great
Blackfoot nation; you are a woman. Your fathers
killed men; <i>you</i> are afraid to kill cattle.&#8221; Smith
turned from him contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;My heart is as strong as yours. I am ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was dusk when Smith returned and held out
a blood-stained flour sack to the squaw.</p>
<p>&#8220;Liver. A two-year ole.&#8221;</p>
<p>The squaw&#8217;s eyes sparkled. Ah, this was as it
should be! Her man provided for her; he brought
her meat to eat. He was clever and brave, for it
was other men&#8217;s meat he brought her to eat. MacDonald
had killed only his own cattle, and secretly
it had shamed her, for she mistook his honesty
for lack of courage. To steal was legitimate; it
was brave; something to be told among friends
at night, and laughed over. Susie, she had observed
with regret, was honest, like her father. She
patted the back of Smith&#8217;s hand, and looked at
him with dog-like, adoring eyes as they stood in
the log meat-house, where fresh quarters hung.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d do more nor this for you, Prairie Flower;&#8221;
and, laying his hand upon her shoulder, he pressed
it with his finger-tips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, but that&#8217;s great liver!&#8221; Tubbs reached
half the length of the table and helped himself
a third time. &#8220;That&#8217;d make a man fight his
grandmother. Who butchered it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me,&#8221; Smith answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;It tastes like slow elk,&#8221; said Susie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you oughtn&#8217;t to eat it till you&#8217;re showed
the hide,&#8221; Smith suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I oughtn&#8217;t,&#8221; Susie retorted. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
see any fresh hide a-hangin&#8217; on the fence. We <i>always</i>
hangs <i>our</i> hides.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>never</i> hangs <i>my</i> hides. I cuts &#8217;em up in strips
and braids &#8217;em into throw-ropes. It&#8217;s safer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The grub-liners laughed at the inference which
Smith so coolly implied.</p>
<p>The finding of White Antelope&#8217;s body, and its
subsequent burial, had delayed the opening of
Dora&#8217;s night-school, so Smith, for reasons of his
own, had spent much of his time in the bunk-house,
covertly studying the grub-liners, who passed the
hours exchanging harrowing experiences of their
varied careers.</p>
<p>A strong friendship had sprung up between
Susie and McArthur. While Susie liked and
greatly admired the Schoolmarm, she never yet
had opened her heart to her. Beyond their actual
school-work, they seemed to have little in common;
and it was a real disappointment and regret to
the Schoolmarm that, for some reason which she
could not reach, she had never been able to break
through the curious reserve of the little half-breed,
who, superficially, seemed so transparently frank.
Each time that she made the attempt, she found
herself repulsed&mdash;gently, even tactfully, but repulsed.</p>
<p>Dora Marshall did not suspect that these rebuffs
were due to an error of her own. In the beginning,
when Susie had questioned her naïvely of the outside
world, she had permitted amusement to show in her
face and manner. She never fully recognized the
fact that while Susie to all appearances, intents, and
purposes was Anglo-Saxon, an equal quantity of
Indian blood flowed in her veins, and that this blood,
with its accompanying traits and characteristics,
must be reckoned with.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Susie was suspicious, unforgiving,
with all the Indians&#8217; sensitiveness to
and fear of ridicule. She meant never again to
entertain the Schoolmarm by her ignorant questions,
although she yearned with all a young girl&#8217;s
yearning for some one in whom to confide&mdash;some one
with whom she could discuss the future which she
often questioned and secretly dreaded.</p>
<p>With real adroitness Susie had tested McArthur,
searching his face for the glimmer of amusement
which would have destroyed irredeemably any
chance of real comradeship between them. But invariably
McArthur had answered her questions
gravely; and when her tears had fallen fast and
hot at White Antelope&#8217;s grave, she had known,
with an intuition both savage and childish, that
his sympathy was sincere. She had felt, too, the
genuineness of his interest when, later, she had
repeated to him many of the stories White Antelope
had told her of the days when he and her
father had trapped and hunted together in the big
woods to the north.</p>
<p>So to-night, when the living-room was deserted
by all save her mother, at work on her rugs in the
corner, Susie confided to him her Great Secret, and
McArthur, some way, felt strangely flattered by
the confidence. He had no desire to laugh; indeed,
there were times when the tears were perilously
close to the surface. He had been a shy,
lonely student, and quite as lonely as a man, yet
through the promptings of a heart sympathetic
and kind and with the fine instinct of gentle birth,
he understood the bizarre little half-breed in a way
which surprised himself.</p>
<p>There was a settee on one side of the room, made
of elk-horns and interwoven buckskin thongs, and
it was there, in the whisper which makes a secret
doubly alluring, that Susie told him of her plans;
but first she brought from some hiding-place outside
a long pasteboard box, carefully wrapped and
tied.</p>
<p>McArthur, puffing on the briar-wood pipe which
he was seldom without, waited with interest, but
without showing curiosity, for he felt that, in a
way, this was a critical moment in their friendship.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you didn&#8217;t see me here on the reservation,
would you know I was Injun?&#8221; Susie demanded,
facing him.</p>
<p>McArthur regarded her critically.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have certain characteristics&mdash;your rather
high cheek-bones, for instance&mdash;and your skin has
a peculiar tint.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got an awful complexion on me,&#8221; Susie
agreed, &#8220;but I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to fix that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, your movements and gestures&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s from talkin&#8217; signs, maybe. I can talk
signs so fast that the full-bloods themselves have
to ask me to slow up. But, now, if you saw me
with my hair frizzled&mdash;all curled up, like, and
pegged down on top of my head&mdash;and a red silk
dress on me with a long skirt, and shiny shoes
coming to a point, and a white hat with birds and
flowers staked out on it, and maybe kid gloves on
my hands&mdash;would you know right off it was me?
Would you say, &#8216;Why, there&#8217;s that Susie MacDonald&mdash;that
breed young un from the reservation&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; declared McArthur firmly; &#8220;I certainly
never should say, &#8216;Why, there&#8217;s that Susie MacDonald&mdash;that
breed young un from the reservation.&#8217;
As a matter of fact,&#8221; he went on gravely,
&#8220;I should probably say, &#8216;What a pity that a
young lady so intelligent and high-spirited should
frizz her hair&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you?&#8221; insisted Susie delightedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly,&#8221; McArthur replied, with satisfying
emphasis.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how long do you think it would take me
to stop slingin&#8217; the buckskin and learn to talk like
you?&mdash;to say big words without bitin&#8217; my tongue
and gettin&#8217; red in the face?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I use large words frequently?&#8221; McArthur
asked in real surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoppers!&#8221; said Susie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do it unconsciously.&#8221; McArthur&#8217;s tone was
apologetic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shrink from appearing pedantic,&#8221; said McArthur,
half to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; Susie declared mischievously. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know what it is, but I shrink from it. Do
you think I could learn big words?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221; McArthur wondered where all
these questions led.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever notice that I&#8217;m kind of polite
sometimes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Frequently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I say &#8217;If you please&#8217; and &#8217;Thank you,&#8217;
and did you notice the other morning when I asked
Old Man Rulison how his ribs was getting along
that Arkansaw Red kicked in, and said I was sorry
the accident happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>McArthur nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I didn&#8217;t mean it.&#8221; She giggled. &#8220;That
was just my manners that I was practisin&#8217; on him.
He was onery, and only got what was comin&#8217; to
him; but if you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to be polite, seems like
you dassn&#8217;t tell the truth. But Miss Marshall says
that &#8217;Thank you,&#8217; &#8216;If you please,&#8217; and &#8216;Good
morning, how&#8217;s your ribs?&#8217; are kind of pass-words
out in the world that help you along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Susie; that&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;m tryin&#8217; to catch onto all I can, because&#8221;&mdash;her
eyes dilated, and she lowered her voice&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m
goin&#8217; out in the world pretty soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To school?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to hunt up Dad&#8217;s relations; and
when I find &#8217;em, I don&#8217;t want &#8217;em to be ashamed of
me, and of him for marryin&#8217; into the Injuns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They need never be ashamed of you, Susie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honest? Honest, don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221; She
looked at him wistfully. &#8220;I&#8217;d try awful hard not
to make breaks,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;and make &#8217;em feel
like cachin&#8217; me in the cellar when they saw company
comin&#8217;. It&#8217;s just plumb awful to be lonesome
here, like I am sometimes; to be homesick for something
or somebody&mdash;for other kind of folks besides
Injuns and grub-liners, and Schoolmarms that
look at you as if you was a new, queer kind of
bug, and laugh at you with their eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad&#8217;s got kin, I know; for lots of times
when I would go with him to hunt horses, he would
say, &#8216;I&#8217;ll take you back to see them some time,
Susie, girl.&#8217; But he never said where &#8217;back&#8217; was,
so I&#8217;ve got to find out myself. Wouldn&#8217;t it be
awful, though&#8221;&mdash;and her chin quivered&mdash;&#8220;if after
I&#8217;d been on the trail for days and days, and my
ponies were foot-sore, they wasn&#8217;t glad to see me
when I rode up to the house, but hinted around
that horse-feed was short and grub was scarce, and
they couldn&#8217;t well winter me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t do that,&#8221; said McArthur reassuringly.
&#8220;Nobody named MacDonald would do
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie began to untie the pasteboard box which
contained her treasures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly ever since Dad died, I&#8217;ve been getting
ready to go. I don&#8217;t mean that I would leave
Mother for keeps&mdash;of course not; but after I&#8217;ve
found &#8217;em, maybe I can coax &#8217;em to come and live
with us. I used to ask White Antelope every question
I could think of, but all he knew was that
after they&#8217;d sold their furs to the Hudson Bay
Company, they sometimes went to a lodge in Canada
called Selkirk, where almost everybody there was
named MacDonald or MacDougal or Mackenzie or
Mac something. Lots of his friends there married
Sioux and went to the Walla Walla valley, and
maybe I&#8217;ll have to go there to find somebody who
knew him; but first I&#8217;ll go to Selkirk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take a good pack-outfit, and Running Rabbit
to find trails and wrangle horses. See&mdash;I&#8217;ve
got my trail all marked out on the map.&#8221;</p>
<p>She unfolded a worn leaf from a school geography.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as if it was only a sleep or two away,
but White Antelope said it was the big ride&mdash;maybe
a hundred sleeps. And lookee&#8221;&mdash;she unfolded
fashion plates of several periods. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
even picked out the clothes I&#8217;ll buy to put on
when I get nearly to the ranch where they live. I
can make camp, you know, and change my clothes,
and then go walkin&#8217; down the road carryin&#8217; this
here parasol and wearin&#8217; this here white hat and
holdin&#8217; up this here long skirt like Teacher on
Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t they be surprised when they open the
door and see me standin&#8217; on the door-step? I&#8217;ll
say, &#8216;How do you do? I&#8217;m Susie MacDonald,
your relation what&#8217;s come to visit you.&#8217; I think
this would be better than showin&#8217; up with Running
Rabbit and the pack-outfit, until I&#8217;d kind of broke
the news to &#8217;em. I&#8217;d keep Running Rabbit cached
in the brush till I sent for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, I&#8217;ve thought about it so much that
it seems like it was as good as done; but maybe
when I start I won&#8217;t find it so easy. I might have
to ride clear to this Minnesota country, or beyond
the big waters to the New York or Connecticut
country, mightn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might,&#8221; McArthur replied soberly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;d take a lot of jerked elk, and everybody
says grub&#8217;s easy to get if you have money,
I&#8217;d start with about nine ponies in my string, so
it looks like I ought to get through?&#8221;</p>
<p>She waited anxiously for McArthur to express
his opinion.</p>
<p>He wondered how he could disillusionize her,
shatter the dream which he could see had become a
part of her life. Should he explain to her that
when she had crossed the mountains and left behind
her the deserts which constituted the only world
she knew, and by which, with its people, she judged
the country she meant to penetrate, she would find
herself a bewildered little savage in a callous, complex
civilization where she had no place&mdash;wondered
at, gibed at, defeated of her purpose?</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure you have no other clues&mdash;no
old letters, no photographs?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was about to answer when a tapping like the
pecking of a snowbird on a window-sill was heard
on the door.</p>
<p>Susie opened it.</p>
<p>In ludicrous contrast to the timid rap, a huge
figure that all but filled it was framed in the doorway.</p>
<p>It was &#8220;Babe&#8221; from the Bar C ranch; &#8220;Baby&#8221;
Britt, curly-haired, pink-cheeked, with one innocent
blue eye dark from recent impact with a fist,
which gave its owner the appearance of a dissipated
cherub.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evenin&#8217;,&#8221; he said tremulously, his eyes roving
as though in search of some one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I lost a horse&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brown?&#8221; interrupted Susie, with suspicious
interest. &#8220;With a star in the forehead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One white stockin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh-huh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Roached mane?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye-ah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind of a rat-tail?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Left hip knocked down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Babe&#8221; nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saddle-sore?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. Where did you see him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw-w-w,&#8221; rumbled &#8220;Babe&#8221; in disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teacher!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dora Marshall&#8217;s door opened in response to
Susie&#8217;s lusty call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen a brown horse with a star in
its forehead, roached mane&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, g&#8217;wan, Susie!&#8221; In confusion, &#8220;Babe&#8221;
began to remove his spurs, thereby serving notice
upon the Schoolmarm that he had &#8220;come to set a
spell.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the Schoolmarm brought her needlework, and
while she explained to Mr. Britt the exact shadings
which she intended to give to each leaf and flower,
that person sat with his entranced eyes upon her
white hands, with their slender, tapering fingers&mdash;the
smallest, the most beautiful hands, he firmly
believed, in the whole world.</p>
<p>It was not easy to carry on a spirited conversation
with Mr. Britt. At best, his range of
topics was limited, and in his present frame of
mind he was about as vivacious as a deaf mute.
He was quite content to sit with the high heels of
his cowboy boots&mdash;from which a faint odor of the
stable emanated&mdash;hung over the rung of his chair,
and to watch the Schoolmarm&#8217;s hand plying the
needle on that almost sacred sofa-pillow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your work must be very interesting, Mr.
Britt,&#8221; suggested Dora.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dunno as &#8217;tis,&#8221; replied Mr. Britt.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so&mdash;so picturesque.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Britt considered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t say it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you like it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not by a high-kick!&#8221;</p>
<p>If there was one thing upon which Mr. Britt
prided himself more than another, it was upon
knowing how to temper his language to his company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you stick to it, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know how to do anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t get much time to read, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; <i>P&#8217;lice Gazette</i> comes reg&#8217;lar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have no church or social privileges?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, you have no entertainment, no time or
opportunity for amusement, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my, yes,&#8221; Mr. Britt declared heartily.
&#8220;We has a game of stud poker nearly every
Sunday mornin&#8217;, and races in the afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t he sparklin&#8217;?&#8221; whispered Susie across
the room to Dora, who pretended not to hear.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are fond of horses?&#8221; inquired the Schoolmarm,
desperately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I has nothin&#8217; agin &#8217;em.&#8221; He qualified his
statement by adding: &#8220;Leastways, unless they
come from the Buffalo Basin country. Then I
shore hates &#8217;em.&#8221; At last Mr. Britt was upon a
subject upon which he could talk fluently and for
an indefinite length of time. &#8220;You take that there
Buffalo Basin stock,&#8221; he went on earnestly, &#8220;and
they&#8217;re nothin&#8217; but inbred cayuse outlaws. They&#8217;re
treach&#8217;rous. Oneriest horses that ever wore hair.
Can&#8217;t gentle &#8217;em&mdash;simply can&#8217;t be done. They&#8217;ve
piled me up more times than any horses that run.
Sunfishers&mdash;the hull of &#8217;em; rare up and fall over
backwards. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t pleasant ridin&#8217; a horse like
that. Wheel on you quicker&#8217;n a weasel; shy
clean acrost the road at nothin&#8217;; kick&mdash;stand up
and strike at you in the corral. It&#8217;s irritatin&#8217;.
Hard keepers, too. Maybe you&#8217;ve noticed
that blue roan I&#8217;m ridin&#8217;. Well, sir, the way
I&#8217;ve throwed feed into that horse is a scandal,
and the more he eats the worse he
looks. Besides, it spoils them Buffalo Basin
buzzard-heads to eat. Give &#8217;em three square
meals, and you can&#8217;t hardly ride &#8217;em. They ain&#8217;t
stayers, neither; no bottom, seems-like. Forty
miles, and that horse of mine is played out. What
for a horse is that? Is that a horse? Not by a
high-kick! Gimme a buckskin with a black line
down his back, and zebra stripes on his legs&mdash;high
back, square chest&mdash;say, then you got a <i>horse!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>It was apparent enough that Mr. Britt had not
commenced to exhaust the subject of the Buffalo
Basin stock. As a matter of fact, he had barely
started; but the sound of horses coming up the
path, and a whoop outside, caused a suspension of
his conversation.</p>
<p>Something heavy was thrown against the door,
and when Susie opened it a roll of roped canvas
rolled inside, while the lamplight fell upon the
grinning faces of two Bar C cowpunchers.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; The Schoolmarm looked wonderingly
at the bundle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw-w-w!&#8221; Mr. Britt replied, in angry confusion.
&#8220;It&#8217;s my bed. I&#8217;ll put a crimp in them
two for this.&#8221; He shouldered his blankets sheepishly
and went out.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>
<h3>CUPID &#8220;WINGS&#8221; A DEPUTY SHERIFF</h3>
</div>

<p>Riding home next morning with his bed on a
borrowed pack-horse, morose, his mind occupied
with divers plans for punishing the cowpunchers
who had spoiled his evening and made him ridiculous
before the Schoolmarm, &#8220;Babe&#8221; came upon
something in a gulch which caused him to rein
his horse sharply and swing from the saddle.</p>
<p>With an ejaculation of surprise, he pulled a
fresh hide from under a pile of rock, it having
been partially uncovered by coyotes. The brand
had been cut out, and with the sight of this significant
find, the two cowpunchers, their obnoxious
joke, even the Schoolmarm, were forgotten; for
there was a new thief on the range, and a new
thief meant excitement and adventure.</p>
<p>Colonel Tolman&#8217;s deep-set eyes glittered when
he heard the news. As Running Rabbit had said,
on the trail of a cattle-thief he was as relentless
as a bloodhound. He could not eat or sleep in
peace until the man who had robbed him was behind
the bars. The Colonel was an old-time Texas
cattleman, and his herds had ranged from the
Mexican border to the Alberta line. He had made
and lost fortunes. Disease, droughts, and blizzards
had cleaned him out at various times, and always
he had taken his medicine without a whimper; but
the loss of so much as a yearling calf by theft
threw him into a rage that was like hysteria.</p>
<p>His hand shook as he sat down at his desk and
wrote a note to the Stockmen&#8217;s Association, asking
for the services of their best detective. It
meant four days of hard riding to deliver the note,
but the Colonel put it into &#8220;Babe&#8217;s&#8221; hand as if
he were asking him to drop it in the mail-box
around the corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go, and git back,&#8221; were his laconic instructions,
and he turned to pace the floor.</p>
<p>When &#8220;Babe&#8221; returned some eight days later,
with the deputy sheriff, he found the Colonel
striding to and fro, his wrath having in no wise
abated. The cowboy wondered if his employer
had been walking the floor all that time.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Ralston,&#8221; said the tall young
deputy, as he stood before the old cattleman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralston?&#8221; The Colonel rose on his toes a
trifle to peer into his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not Dick Ralston&#8217;s boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>The six-foot deputy smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Colonel&#8217;s hand shot out in greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody of that name is pretty near like kin
to me. Many&#8217;s the time your dad and I have
eaten out of the same frying-pan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;ve heard him say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he know you&#8217;re down here on this job?&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man shook his head soberly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Colonel looked at him keenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Had a falling out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; scarcely that; but we couldn&#8217;t agree
exactly upon some things, so I struck out for
myself when I came home from college.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No future for you in this sleuthing business,&#8221;
commented the old man tersely. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t
you go into cattle with your dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where we disagreed, sir. I wanted to
buy sheep, and he goes straight into the air at the
very word.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Colonel laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can believe that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over there the range is going fast, and it&#8217;s
fight and scrap and quarrel all the time to keep
the sheep off what little there is left; and then
you ship and bottom drops out of the market as
soon as your cattle are loaded. There&#8217;s nothing
in it; and while I don&#8217;t like sheep any better
than the Governor, there&#8217;s no use in hanging on
and going broke in cattle because of a prejudice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dick&#8217;s stubborn,&#8221;&mdash;the Colonel nodded knowingly&mdash;&#8220;and
I don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;ll ever give in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I don&#8217;t think he will, and I&#8217;m sorry for
his sake, because he&#8217;s getting too old to worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Worry? Cattle&#8217;s nothing but worry!&mdash;which
reminds me of what you are here for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any suspicions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I don&#8217;t believe I can help you any. The
Injuns been good as pie since we sent Wolf Robe
over the road. Don&#8217;t hardly think it&#8217;s Injuns.
Don&#8217;t know what to think. Might be some of
these Mormon outfits going north. Might be some
of these nesters off in the hills. Might be anybody!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he an old hand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like it. Cuts the brand out and buries
the hide.&#8221; The Colonel began pacing the floor.
&#8220;Cattle-thieves are people that&#8217;s got to be nipped
in the bud <i>muy pronto</i>. There ought to be a lynching
on every cattle-range once in seven years. It&#8217;s
the only way to hold &#8217;em level. Down there on
the Rio Grande we rode away and left fourteen
of &#8217;em swinging over the bluff. It&#8217;s got to be done
in all cattle countries, and since they&#8217;ve started
in here&mdash;well, a hanging is overdue by two years.&#8221;
The Colonel ejected his words with the decisive click
of a riot-gun.</p>
<p>So Dick Ralston, Jr., rode the range for the
purpose of getting the lay of the country, and,
on one pretext or another, visited the squalid homes
of the nesters, but nowhere found anybody or
anything in the least suspicious. He learned of
the murder of White Antelope, and of the &#8220;queer-actin&#8217;&#8221;
bug-hunter and his pal, who had been
accused of it. It was rather generally believed
that McArthur was a desperado of a new and
original kind. While it was conceded that he
seemed to have no way of disposing of the meat,
and certainly could not kill a cow and eat it himself,
it was nevertheless declared that he was
&#8220;worth watching.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the hangers-on at the MacDonald ranch
were all known to have records, no particular suspicion
had attached to them in this instance, because
the squaw was known to kill her own beef, and
no shadow of doubt had ever fallen upon the good
name of the ranch.</p>
<p>The trapping of cattle-thieves is not the work
of a day or a week, but sometimes of months; and
when evidence of another stolen beef was found
upon the range, Ralston realized that his efforts
lay in that vicinity for some time to come. He
decided to ride over to the MacDonald ranch that
evening and have a look at the bad <i>hombre</i> who
masqueraded as a bug-hunter&mdash;bug-hunter, it
should be explained, being a Western term for any
stranger engaged in scientific pursuits.</p>
<p>While Ralston was riding over the lonely road
in the moonlight, Dora was arranging the dining-room
table for her night-school, which had been in
session several evenings. Smith was studying
grammar, of which branch of learning Dora had
decided he stood most in need, while Susie groaned
over compound fractions.</p>
<p>Tubbs, with his chair tilted against the wall,
looked on with a tolerant smile. In the kitchen,
paring a huge pan of potatoes for breakfast, Ling
listened with such an intensity of interest to what
was being said that his ears seemed fairly to quiver.
From her bench in the living-room, the Indian
woman braided rags and darted jealous glances at
teacher and pupil. Smith, his hair looking like
a bunch of tumble-weed in a high wind, hung over
a book with a look of genuine misery upon his
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t have any notion there was so much
in the world I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; he burst out. &#8220;I
thought when I&#8217;d learnt that if you sprinkle your
saddle-blanket you can hold the biggest steer that
runs, without your saddle slippin&#8217;, I&#8217;d learnt about
all they was worth knowin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tedious,&#8221; Dora admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tedious?&#8221; echoed Smith in loud pathos. &#8220;It&#8217;s
hell! Say, I can tie a fancy knot in a bridle-rein
that can&#8217;t be beat by any puncher in the country,
but <i>darn</i> me if I can see the difference between a
adjective and one of these here adverbs! Once I
thought I knowed something&mdash;me, Smith&mdash;but say,
I don&#8217;t know enough to make a mark in the
road!&#8221;</p>
<p>Closing his eyes and gritting his teeth, he repeated:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have had, you have had, he has had.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you would have had about six drinks, I
think you could git that,&#8221; observed Tubbs
judicially, watching Smith&#8217;s mental suffering with
keen interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be discouraged,&#8221; said Dora cheerfully,
seating herself beside him. &#8220;Let&#8217;s take a little
review. Do you remember what I told you about
this?&#8221;</p>
<p>She pointed to the letter <i>a</i> marked with the long
sound.</p>
<p>Smith ran both hands through his hair, while a
wild, panic-stricken look came upon his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dog-gone me! I know it&#8217;s a <i>a</i>, but I plumb
forget how you called it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tubbs unhooked his toes from the chair-legs and
walked around to look over Smith&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Smith, you got a great forgitter,&#8221; he said
sarcastically. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you use your head a
little? That there is a Bar A. You ought to
have knowed that. The Bar A stock run all over
the Judith Basin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember I told you that whenever
you saw that mark over a letter you should give
it the long sound?&#8221; explained Dora patiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like the <i>a</i> in &#8216;aig,&#8217;&#8221; elucidated Tubbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like the <i>a</i> in &#8216;snake,&#8217;&#8221; corrected the Schoolmarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or &#8217;wake,&#8217; or &#8217;skate,&#8217; or &#8216;break,&#8217;&#8221; said Smith
hopefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; declared the Schoolmarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knowed that much myself,&#8221; said Tubbs enviously.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll pardon me, Mr. Tubbs,&#8221; said Dora,
in some irritation, &#8220;there is no such word as
&#8216;knowed.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you talk grammatical, Tubbs?&#8221;
Smith demanded, with alacrity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I talks what I knows,&#8221; said Tubbs, going back
to his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you forgotten all I told you about adjectives?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Adjectives is words describin&#8217; things. They&#8217;s
two kinds, comparative and superlative,&#8221; Smith replied
promptly. He added. &#8220;Adjectives kind of
stuck in my craw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you give me examples?&#8221; Dora felt encouraged.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got a horrible pretty hand,&#8221; Smith replied,
without hesitation. &#8220;&#8216;Horrible pretty&#8217; is
a adjective describin&#8217; your hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dora burst out laughing, and Tubbs, without
knowing why, joined in heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tubbs,&#8221; continued Smith, glaring at that person,
&#8220;has got the horriblest mug I ever seen, and
if he opens it and laffs like that at me again, I
aims to break his head. &#8217;Horriblest&#8217; is a superlative
adjective describin&#8217; Tubbs&#8217;s mug.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Smith&#8217;s chagrin and Tubbs&#8217;s delight, Dora
explained that &#8220;horrible&#8221; was a word which could
not be used in conjunction with &#8220;pretty,&#8221; and
that its superlative was not &#8220;horriblest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith buried his head in his hands despondently.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I was where I could, I&#8217;d get drunk!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing to feel so badly about,&#8221; said Dora
comfortingly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go back to prepositions.
Can you define a preposition?&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith screwed up his face and groped for words,
but before he found them Tubbs broke in:</p>
<p>&#8220;A preposition is what a feller has to sell that
nobody wants,&#8221; he explained glibly. &#8220;They&#8217;s copper
prepositions, silver-lead prepositions, and onct
I had a oil preposition up in the Swift Current
country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith reached inside his coat and pulled out
the carved, ivory-handled six-shooter which he
wore in a holster under his arm. He laid it on
the table beside his grammar, and looked at Tubbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Feller,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I hates to make a gun-play
before the Schoolmarm, but if you jump into this
here game again, I aims to try a chunk of lead on
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If book-learnin&#8217; ud ever make me as peevish
as it does you,&#8221; declared Tubbs, rising hastily, &#8220;I
hopes I never knows nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tubbs slammed the door behind him as he went
to seek more amiable company in the bunk-house.</p>
<p>Save for the Indian woman, Smith and Dora
were now practically alone; for Ling had gone
to bed, and Susie was oblivious to everything except
fractions. Smith continued to struggle with
prepositions, adjectives, and adverbs, but he found
it difficult to concentrate his thoughts on them
with Dora so close beside him. He knew that
his slightest glance, every expression which crossed
his face, was observed by the Indian woman; and
although he did his utmost not to betray his feelings,
he saw the sullen, jealous resentment rising
within her.</p>
<p>She read aright the light in his eyes; besides,
her intuitions were greater than his powers of
concealment. When she could no longer endure
the sight of Smith and the Schoolmarm sitting side
by side, she laid down her work and slipped out
into the star-lit night, closing the door softly behind
her.</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s judgment told him that he should end
the lesson and go after her, but the spell of love
was upon him, overwhelming him, holding him fast
in delicious thraldom. He had not the strength
of will just then to break it.</p>
<p>Dora had been reading &#8220;Hiawatha&#8221; aloud each
evening to Susie, Tubbs, and Smith, so when she
finally closed the grammar, she asked if he would
like to hear more of the Indian story, as he called
it, to which he nodded assent.</p>
<p>Dora read well, with intelligence and sympathy;
her trained voice was flexible. Then, too, she
loved this greatest of American legends. It appealed
to her audience as perhaps no other poem
would have done. It was real to them, it was
&#8220;life,&#8221; their life in a little different environment
and told in a musical rhythm which held them
breathless, enchanted.</p>
<p>Dora had reached the story of &#8220;The Famine.&#8221;
She knew the refrain by heart, and the wail of old
Nokomis was in her voice as she repeated from
memory:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Wahonowin! Wahonowin!</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>So they buried Minnehaha.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The pathos of the lines never failed to touch
Dora anew. Her voice broke, and, pausing to recover
herself, she glanced at Smith. There were
tears in his eyes. The brutal chin was quivering
like that of a tender-hearted child.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man that wrote that was a <i>chief</i>,&#8221; he
said huskily. &#8220;It hurts me here&mdash;in my neck.&#8221;
He rubbed the contracted muscles of his throat.
&#8220;I&#8217;d feel like that, girl, if you should die.&#8221;</p>
<p>He repeated softly, and choked:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;All my heart is buried with you,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>All my thoughts go onward with you!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The impression which the poem made upon
Smith was deep. It was a constant surprise to him
also. The thoughts it expressed, the sensations it
described, he had believed were entirely original with
himself. He had not conceived it possible that
any one else could feel toward a woman as he felt
toward Dora. Therefore, when the poet put many
of his heart-throbs into words, they startled him,
as though, somehow, his own heart were photographed
and held up to view.</p>
<p>Susie had finished her lesson, and, cramped from
sitting, was walking about the living-room to rest
herself, while this conversation was taking place.
Her glance fell upon a gaudy vase on a shelf,
and some thought came to her which made her
laugh mischievously. She emptied the contents of
the vase into the palm of her hand and, closing
the other over it, tiptoed into the dining-room
and stood behind Smith.</p>
<p>Dora and he, engrossed in conversation, paid
no attention to her. She put her cupped palms
close to Smith&#8217;s ear and, shaking them vigorously,
shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;Snakes!&#8221;</p>
<p>The result was such as Susie had not anticipated.</p>
<p>With a shriek which was womanish in its shrillness,
Smith sprang to his feet, all but upsetting
the lamp in his violence. Unmixed horror was written
upon his face.</p>
<p>The girl herself shrank back at what she had
done; then, holding out several rattles for inspection,
she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like you don&#8217;t care for snakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you little&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Only Susie guessed the unspeakable epithet he
meant to use. Her eyes warned him, and, too, he
remembered Dora in time. He said instead, with
a slight laugh of confusion:</p>
<p>&#8220;Snakes scares me, and rat-traps goin&#8217; off.&#8221;</p>
<p>The color had not yet returned to his face when
a knock came upon the door.</p>
<p>In response to Susie&#8217;s call, a tall stranger
stepped inside&mdash;a stranger wide of shoulder, and
with a kind of grim strength in his young face.</p>
<p>From the unnatural brightness of the eyes of
Susie and of Smith, and their still tense attitudes,
Ralston sensed the fact that something had happened.
He returned Smith&#8217;s unpleasant look with
a gaze as steady as his own. Then his eyes fell
upon Dora and lingered there.</p>
<p>She had sprung to her feet and was still standing.
Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes luminous,
and the soft lamplight burnishing her brown hair
made the moment one of her best. Smith saw
the frank admiration in the stranger&#8217;s look.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I stop here to-night?&#8221; He addressed
Dora.</p>
<p>He had the characteristic Western gravity of
manner and expression, the distinguishing definiteness
of purpose. Though the quality of his
voice, its modulation, bespoke the man of poise
and education, the accent was unmistakably of the
West.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a bunk-house.&#8221; It was Smith who
answered.</p>
<p>His unuttered epithet still rankled; Susie
turned upon him with insulting emphasis:</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;d better get out to it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you the boss here?&#8221; The stranger put
the question to Smith with cool politeness.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I say <i>goes!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith looked marvellously ugly.</p>
<p>Susie leaned toward him, and her childish face
was distorted with anger as she shrieked:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Not yet, Mister Smith!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Involuntarily, Dora and the stranger exchanged
glances in the awkward silence which followed.
Then, more to relieve her embarrassment than for
any other reason, Ralston said quietly, &#8220;Very
well, I will do as this&mdash;gentleman suggests,&#8221; and
withdrew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; said Dora, gathering up her
books; but neither Smith nor Susie answered.</p>
<p>With both hands deep in his trousers&#8217; pockets,
Smith was smiling at Susie, with a smile which
was little short of devilish; and the girl, throwing
a last look of defiance at him, also left the
room, violently slamming behind her the door of
the bed-chamber occupied by her mother and herself.</p>
<p>For a full minute Smith stood as they had left
him&mdash;motionless, his eyelids drooping. Rousing
himself, he went to the window and looked into
the moonlight-flooded world outside. Huddled in a
blanket, a squat figure sat on a fallen cottonwood
tree.</p>
<p>Smith eyed it, then asked himself contemptuously:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t that pure Injun?&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking his hat, he too stepped into the moonlight.</p>
<p>The woman did not look up at his approach, so
he stooped until his cheek touched hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Prairie Flower?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My heart is under my feet.&#8221; Her voice was
harsh.</p>
<p>In the tone one uses to a sulky child, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come into the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You no like me, white man. You like de
white woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith reached under the blanket and took her
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you marry de white woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>He pressed her hand tightly against his heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come into the house, Prairie Flower.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face relaxed like that of a child when it
smiles through its tears. And Smith, in the hour
when the first real love of his life was at its zenith,
when his heart was so full of it that it seemed
well nigh bursting, walked back to the house with
the squaw clinging tightly to his fingers.</p>

<h3>THE BUG-HUNTER ELUCIDATES</h3>
</div>

<p>The same instinct which made Ralston recognize
Susie as his friend told him that Smith was his
enemy; though, verily, that person who would have
construed as evidences of esteem and budding
friendship Smith&#8217;s black looks when Ralston presumed
to talk with Dora, even upon the most
ordinary topics, would have been dull of comprehension
indeed.</p>
<p>While no reason for remaining appeared to be
necessary at the MacDonald ranch, Ralston hinted
at hunting stray horses; and casually expressed a
hope that he might be able to pick up a bunch of
good ponies at a reasonable figure&mdash;which explanation
was entirely satisfactory to all save
Smith. The latter frequently voiced the opinion
that Ralston lingered solely for the purpose of
courting the Schoolmarm, an opinion which the
grub-liners agreed was logical, since they too, along
with the majority of unmarried males for fifty
miles around, cherished a similar ambition.</p>
<p>Dora had long since ceased to consider as extraordinary
the extended visits which strangers
paid to the ranch; therefore, she saw nothing
unusual in the fact that Ralston stayed on.</p>
<p>If furtive-eyed and restless passers-by arrived
after dark, slept in the hay near their unsaddled
horses, and departed at dawn, assuredly no person
at the MacDonald ranch was rude enough to ask
reasons for their haste. Its hospitality was as
boundless, as free, as the range itself; and if upon
leaving any guest had happened to express gratitude
for food and shelter, it is doubtful if any
incident could more have surprised Susie and her
mother, unless, mayhap, it might have been an
offer of payment for the same.</p>
<p>Ralston told himself that, since he could remain
without comment, the ranch was much better
situated for his purpose than Colonel Tolman&#8217;s
home; but the really convincing point in its favor,
though one which he refused to recognize as influencing
him in the least, was that he was nearer
Dora by something like eight miles than he would
have been at the Bar C. Then, too, though there
was nothing tangible to justify his suspicions,
Ralston believed that his work lay close at hand.</p>
<p>Like Colonel Tolman, he had come to think
that it was not the Indians who were killing; and
the nesters, though a spiritless, shiftless lot, had
always been honest enough. But the bunk-house
on the MacDonald ranch was often filled with the
material of which horse and cattle thieves are made,
and Ralston hoped that he might get a clue from
some word inadvertently dropped there.</p>
<p>He often thought that he never had seen a
more heterogeneous gathering than that which
assembled at times around the table. And with
Longfellow in the dining-room, ethnological dissertations
in one end of the bunk-house, and personal
reminiscences and experiences in gun-fights
and affairs of the heart in the other end, there was
afforded a sufficient variety of mental diversion
to suit nearly any taste.</p>
<p>McArthur in the rôle of desperado seemed preposterous
to Ralston; yet he remembered that Ben
Reed, a graduate of a theological seminary, who
could talk tears into the eyes of an Apache, was
the slickest stock thief west of the Mississippi.
He was well aware that a pair of mild eyes and
gentle, ingenuous manners are many a rogue&#8217;s most
valuable asset, and though the bug-hunter talked
frankly of his pilgrimages into the hills, there was
always a chance that his pursuit was a pose, his
zeal counterfeit.</p>
<p>One evening which was typical of others, Ralston
sat on the edge of his bunk, rolling an occasional
cigarette and listening with huge enjoyment to the
conversation of a group around the sheet-iron
stove, of which McArthur was the central figure.</p>
<p>McArthur, riding his hobby enthusiastically,
quite forgot the character of his listeners, and laid
his theories regarding the interchange of mammalian
life between America and Asia during the
early Pleistocene period, before Meeteetse Ed, Old
Man Rulison, Tubbs, and others, in the same language
in which he would have argued moot questions
with colleagues engaged in similar research.
The language of learning was as natural to
McArthur as the vernacular of the West was to
Tubbs, and in moments of excitement he lapsed into
it as a foreigner does into his native tongue under
stress of feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I maintain,&#8221; asserted McArthur, with a gesture
of emphasis, &#8220;that the Paleolithic man of
Europe followed the mastodon to North America
and here remained.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meeteetse Ed, whose cheeks were flushed, laid his
hot hand upon his forehead and declared plaintively
as he blinked at McArthur:</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardner, I&#8217;m gittin&#8217; a headache from tryin&#8217;
to see what you&#8217;re talkin&#8217; about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Air you sayin&#8217; anything a-tall,&#8221; demanded Old
Man Rulison, suspiciously, &#8220;or air you joshin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Them&#8217;s words all right,&#8221; said Tubbs. &#8220;Onct
I worked under a section boss over on the Great
Northern what talked words like them. He believed
we sprung up from tuds and lizards&mdash;and the likes
o&#8217; that. Yes, he did&mdash;on the square.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many believers in the theory of
evolution,&#8221; observed McArthur.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it&mdash;that&#8217;s the word. That&#8217;s what he
was.&#8221; Then, in the tone of one who hands out a
clincher, Tubbs demanded: &#8220;Look here, Doc, if
that&#8217;s so why ain&#8217;t all these ponds and cricks around
here a-hatchin&#8217; out children?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess that&#8217;ll hold him for a minute,&#8221; Meeteetse
Ed whispered to his neighbor.</p>
<p>But instead of being covered with confusion by
this seemingly unanswerable argument, McArthur
gazed at Tubbs in genuine pity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me consider how I can make it quite clear
to you. Perhaps,&#8221; he said thoughtfully, &#8220;I cannot
do better than to give you Herbert Spencer&#8217;s
definition. Spencer defines evolution, as nearly as
I can remember his exact words, as an integration
of matter and concomita, dissipation of motion;
during which the matter passes from an indefinite
heterogeneity to a definite, incoherent heterogeneity,
and during which the retained motion undergoes
a parallel transformation. Materialistic,
agnostic, and theistic evolution&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Meeteetse Ed fell off his chair in a mock faint
and crashed to the floor.</p>
<p>Susie, who had entered, saw McArthur&#8217;s embarrassment,
and refused to join in the shout of
laughter, though her eyes danced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind him,&#8221; she said comfortingly, as she
eyed Meeteetse, sprawled on his back with his eyes
closed. &#8220;He&#8217;s afraid he&#8217;ll learn something. He
used to be a sheep-herder, and I don&#8217;t reckon he&#8217;s
got more&#8217;n two hundred and fifty words in his
whole vocabulary. Why, I&#8217;ll bet he never <i>heard</i>
a word of more&#8217;n three syllables before. Get up,
Meeteetse. Go out in the fresh air and build yourself
a couple of them sheep-herder&#8217;s monuments.
It&#8217;ll make you feel better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prostrate humorist revived. Susie&#8217;s jeers
had the effect of a bucket of ice-water, for he had
not been aware that this blot upon his escutcheon&mdash;the
disgraceful epoch in his life when he had
earned honest money herding sheep&mdash;was known.</p>
<p>&#8220;My enthusiasm runs away with me when I
get upon this subject,&#8221; said McArthur, in blushing
apology to the group. &#8220;I am sorry that I
have bored you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No bore a-tall,&#8221; declared Old Man Rulison
magnanimously. &#8220;You cut loose whenever you feel
like it: we kin stand it as long as you kin.&#8221;</p>
<p>After McArthur had gone to his pneumatic mattress
in the patent tent pitched near the bunk-house,
Ralston said to Susie:</p>
<p>&#8220;You and the bug-hunter are great friends,
aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet! We&#8217;re pardners. Anybody that
gets funny with him has got me to fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s like that, is it?&#8221; Ralston laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got secrets&mdash;the bug-hunter and me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re rather young for secrets, Susie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody&#8217;s too young for secrets,&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you any?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; Ralston nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like you,&#8221; Susie whispered impulsively.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s swap secrets.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her and wished he dared. He
would have liked to tell her of his mission, to ask
her help; for he realized that, if she chose, no
one could help him more. Like Smith, he recognized
that quality in her they each called &#8220;gameness,&#8221;
and even more than Smith he appreciated
the commingling of Scotch shrewdness and Indian
craft. He believed Susie to be honest; but he had
believed many things in the past which time had
not demonstrated to be facts. No, the chance was
too great to take; for should she prove untrustworthy
or indiscreet, his mission would be a failure.
So he answered jestingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;My secrets are not for little girls to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie gave him a quick glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you don&#8217;t look as though you had that
kind,&#8221; and turned away.</p>
<p>Ralston felt somehow that he had lost an opportunity.
He could not rid himself of the feeling
the entire evening; and he made up his mind
to cultivate Susie&#8217;s friendship. But it was too
late; he had made a mistake not unlike Dora&#8217;s.
Susie had felt herself rebuffed, and, like the Schoolmarm,
Ralston had laughed at her with his eyes.
It was a great thing&mdash;a really sacred thing to
Susie&mdash;this secret that she had offered him. The
telling of it to McArthur had been so delightful
an experience that she yearned to repeat it, but
now she meant never to tell any one else. Any
way, McArthur was her &#8220;pardner,&#8221; and it was
enough that he should know. So it came about
that afterwards, when Ralston sought her company
and endeavored to learn something of the
workings of her mind, he found the same barrier
of childish reserve which had balked Dora, and no
amount of tact or patience seemed able to break
it down.</p>
<p>The young deputy sheriff&#8217;s interest in Dora increased
in leaps and bounds. He experienced an
odd but delightful agitation when he saw the
sleepy white pony plodding down the hill, and
the sensation became one easily defined each
time that he observed Smith&#8217;s horse ambling
in the road beside hers. The feeling which inspired
Tubbs&#8217;s disgruntled comment, &#8220;Smith rides
herd on the Schoolmarm like a cow outfit in a bad
wolf country,&#8221; found an echo in Ralston&#8217;s own
breast. Truly, Smith guarded the Schoolmarm
with the vigilance of a sheep-dog.</p>
<p>He saw a possible rival in every new-comer, but
most of all he feared Ralston; for Smith was not
too blinded by prejudice to appreciate the fact
that Ralston was handsome in a strong, man&#8217;s
way, younger than himself, and possessed of the
advantages of education which enabled him to talk
with Dora upon subjects that left him, Smith,
dumb. Such times were wormwood and gall to
Smith; yet in his heart he never doubted but that
he would have Dora and her love in the end. Smith&#8217;s
faith in himself and his ability to get what he
really desired was sublime. The chasm between
himself and Dora&mdash;the difference of birth and education&mdash;meant
nothing to him. It is doubtful if
he recognized it. He would have considered himself
a king&#8217;s equal; indeed, it would have gone
hard with royalty, had royalty by any chance
ordered Smith to saddle his horse. He judged by
the standards of the plains: namely, gameness,
skill, resourcefulness; to him, there <i>were</i> no other
standards. After all, Dora Marshall was only a
woman&mdash;the superior of other women, to be sure,
but a woman; and if he wanted her&mdash;why not?</p>
<p>He would have been amazed, enraged through
wounded vanity, if it had been possible for him
to see himself from Dora&#8217;s point of view: a
subject for reformation; a test for many trite
theories; an erring human to be reclaimed by a
woman&#8217;s benign influence. Naturally, these thoughts
had not suggested themselves to Smith.</p>
<p>Ralston looked forward eagerly to the evening
meal, since it was almost the only time at which
he could exchange a word with Dora. Breakfast
was a hurried affair, while both she and Susie
were absent from the midday dinner. The shy,
fluttering glances which he occasionally surprised
from her, the look of mutual appreciation which
sometimes passed between them at a quaint bit of
philosophy or naïve remark, started his pulses
dancing and set the whole world singing a wordless
song of joy.</p>
<p>Somehow, eating seemed a vulgar function in
the Schoolmarm&#8217;s presence, and he wished with all
his heart that the abominable grammar lessons
which filled her evenings might some time end; in
which case he would be able to converse with her
when not engaged in rushing bread and meat to
and fro.</p>
<p>His most carefully laid plans to obtain a few
minutes alone with her were invariably thwarted
by Smith. And from the heights to which he had
been transported by some more than passing
friendly glance at the table, he was dragged each
evening to the depths by the sight of Dora and
Smith with their heads together over that accursed
grammar.</p>
<p>He commenced to feel a distaste for his bunk-house
associates, and took to wandering out of
doors, pausing most frequently in his meanderings
just outside the circle of light thrown
through the window by the dining-room lamp.
Dora&#8217;s guilelessness in believing that Smith&#8217;s interest
in his lessons was due to a desire for knowledge
did not make the tableau less tantalizing to
Ralston, but it would have been against every tenet
in his code to suggest to Dora that Smith was
not the misguided diamond-in-the-rough which she
believed him.</p>
<p>Smith, on the contrary, had no such scruples.
He lost no opportunity to sneer at Ralston. When
he discovered Dora wearing one of the first flowers
of spring, which Ralston had brought her, Smith
said darkly:</p>
<p>&#8220;That fresh guy is a dead ringer for a feller
that quit his wife and five kids in Livingston and
run off with a biscuit-shooter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dora laughed aloud. The clean-cut and youthful
Ralston deserting a wife and five children for
a &#8220;biscuit-shooter&#8221; was not a convincing picture.
That she did not receive his insinuation seriously
but added fuel to the unreasoning jealousy beginning
to flame in Smith&#8217;s breast.</p>
<p>Yet Smith treated Ralston with a consideration
which was surprising in view of the wanton insults
he frequently inflicted upon those whom he
disliked. Susie guessed the reason for his superficial
courtesy, and Ralston, perhaps, suspected
it also. In his heart, Smith was afraid. First
and always, he was a judge of men&mdash;rather, of
certain qualities in men. He knew that should he
give intentional offense to Ralston, he would be
obliged either to retract or to back up his insult
with a gun. Ralston would be the last man to
accept an affront with meekness.</p>
<p>Smith did not wish affairs to reach this crisis.
He did not want to force an issue until he had
demonstrated to his own satisfaction that he was
the better man of the two with words or fists or
weapons. But once he found the flaw in Ralston&#8217;s
armor, he would speedily become the aggressor.
Such were Smith&#8217;s tactics. He was reckless with
caution; daring when it was safe.</p>
<p>The rôle he was playing gave him no concern.
Though the Indian woman&#8217;s spells of sullenness
irritated him, he conciliated her with endearing
words, caresses, and the promise of a speedy marriage.
He appeased her jealousy of Dora by
telling her that he studied the foolish book-words
only that he might the better work for her interests;
that he was fitting himself to cope with
the shrewd cattlemen with whom there were constant
dealings, and that when they were married,
the Schoolmarm should live elsewhere. Like others
of her sex, regardless of race or color, the Indian
woman believed because she wanted to believe.</p>
<p>Just where his actions were leading him, Smith
did not stop to consider. He had no fear of results.
With an overweening confidence arising from
past successes, he believed that matters would adjust
themselves as they always had. Smith wanted
a home, and the MacDonald cattle, horses, and
hay; but more than any of them he wanted Dora
Marshall. How he was going to obtain them all
was not then clear to him, but that when the time
came he could make a way, he never for a moment
doubted.</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s confidence in himself was supreme. If
he could have expressed his belief in words, he
might have said that he could control Destiny,
shape events and his own life as he liked. He
had been shot at, pursued by posses, all but
lynched upon an occasion, and always he had
escaped in some unlooked-for manner little short
of miraculous. As a result, he had come to cherish
a superstitious belief that he bore a charmed life,
that no real harm could come to him. So he
courted each woman according to her nature as
he read it, and waited blindly for success.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>
<h3>SPEAKING OF GRASSHOPPERS&mdash;&mdash;</h3>
</div>

<p>It was Saturday, and, there being no school,
both Susie and Dora were at home. Ralston was
considering in which direction he should ride that
day when Susie came to him and after saying to
Smith with elaborate politeness, &#8220;Excuse me, Mr.
Smith, for whispering, but I have something very
private and confidential to say to Mr. Ralston,&#8221;
she shielded her mouth with her hand and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Teacher and I are going fishing. We are
going up on the side-hill now to catch grasshoppers
for bait, and I thought maybe you&#8217;d like to help,
and to fish with us this afternoon.&#8221; She tittered in
his ear.</p>
<p>Susie&#8217;s action conveyed two things to Ralston&#8217;s
mind: first, that he had not been so clever as he
had supposed in dissembling his feelings; and
second, that Susie, recognizing them, was disposed
to render him friendly aid.</p>
<p>Smith noted Ralston&#8217;s brightening eye with suspicion,
jumping to the very natural conclusion that
only some pleasing information concerning the
Schoolmarm would account for it. When, a few
minutes later, he saw the three starting away together,
each with a tin or pasteboard box, he
realized that his surmise was correct.</p>
<p>Glowering, Smith walked restlessly about the
house, ignoring the Indian woman&#8217;s inquiring,
wistful eyes, cursing to himself as he wandered
through the corrals and stables, hating with a
personal hatred everything which belonged to
Ralston: his gentle-eyed brown mare; his expensive
Navajo saddle-blanket; his single-rigged
saddle; his bridle with the wide cheek pieces and
the hand-forged bit. It would have been a satisfaction
to destroy them all. He hated particularly
the little brown mare which Ralston brushed with
such care each morning. Smith&#8217;s mood was black
indeed.</p>
<p>But Ralston, as he walked between Dora and
Susie to the side-hill where the first grasshoppers
of spring were always found, felt at peace with
all the world&mdash;even Smith&mdash;and it was in his heart
to hug the elfish half-breed child as she skipped
beside him. Dora&#8217;s frequent, bubbling laughter
made him thrill; he longed to shout aloud like a
schoolboy given an unexpected holiday.</p>
<p>Each time that his eyes sought Dora&#8217;s, shadowed
by the wide brim of her hat, her eyelids drooped,
slowly, reluctantly, as though they fell against her
will, while the color came and went under her
clear skin in a fashion which filled him with delighted
wonder.</p>
<p>It may be said that there are few things in life
so absorbing as catching grasshoppers. While
Ralston previously had recognized this fact, he
never had supposed that it contained any element
of pleasure akin to the delights of Paradise. To
chase grasshoppers by oneself is one thing; to
pursue them in the company of a fascinating schoolmarm
is another; and when one has in his mind
the thought that ultimately he and the schoolmarm
may chance to fall upon the same grasshopper,
the chase becomes a sport for the gods
to envy.</p>
<p>Anent grasshoppers. While the first grasshopper
of early spring has not the devilish agility of
his August descendant, he is sufficiently alert to
make his capture no mean feat. It must be borne
in mind that the grasshopper is not a fool, and
that he appears to see best from the rear. Though
he remains motionless while the enemy is slipping
stealthily upon him, it by no means follows that
he is not aware of said enemy&#8217;s approach. The
grasshopper has a more highly developed sense
of humor than any other known insect. It is an
established fact that after a person has fallen upon
his face and clawed at the earth where the grasshopper
was but is not, the grasshopper will be
seen distinctly to laugh from his coign of vantage
beyond reach.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is quite impossible to fathom
the mind of the grasshopper, his intentions or
habits; particularly those of the small, gray-pink
variety. He is as erratic in his flight as a clay
pigeon, though it is tolerably safe to assume
that he will not jump backward. He may not jump
at all, but, with a deceptive movement, merely sidle
under a sage-leaf. Where questions concerning
his personal safety are concerned, he shows rare
judgment, appearing to recognize exactly the
psychological moment in which to fly, jump, or sit
still.</p>
<p>No sluggard, be it known, can hope to catch
grasshoppers with any degree of success. It requires
an individual nimble of mind and body,
whose nerves are keyed to a tension, who is dominated
by a mood which refuses to recognize the
perils of snakes, cactus, and prairie-dog holes;
forgetful of self and dignity, inured to ridicule.
Such a one is justified in making the attempt.</p>
<p>The large, brownish-black, grandfatherly-looking
grasshopper is the most easily captured, though
not so satisfactory for bait as the pea-green or
the gray-pink. It was to the first variety that
Dora and Ralston devoted themselves, while Susie
followed the smaller and more sprightly around
the hill till she was out of sight.</p>
<p>Ralston became aware that no matter in which
direction the grasshopper he had marked for his
own took him, singularly enough he always ended
in pursuit of Dora&#8217;s. As a matter of fact, her
grasshopper looked so much more desirable than
his, that he could not well do otherwise than abandon
the pursuit of his own for hers.</p>
<p>Her low &#8220;Oh, thank you so much!&#8221; was so
heartfelt and sincere when he pushed the insect
through the slit in her pasteboard box that he truly
believed he would have run one all the way to
the Middle Fork of Powder River only to hear
her say it again. And then her womanly aversion
to inflicting pain, her appealing femininity when she
brought a bulky-bodied, tobacco-chewing grasshopper
for him to pinch its head into insensibility!
He liked this best of all, for, of necessity, their
fingers touched in the exchange, and he wondered
a little at his strength of will in refraining from
catching her hand in his and refusing to let go.</p>
<p>Finally a grasshopper of abnormal size went up
with a whir. Big he was, in comparison with
his kind, as the monster steer in the side-show,
the Cardiff giant, or Jumbo the mammoth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried Dora; &#8220;we must have him!&#8221; and
they ran side by side in wild, determined pursuit.</p>
<p>The insect sailed far and fast, but they could
not lose sight of him, for he was like an aeroplane
in flight, and when in an ill-advised moment he lit
to gather himself, they fell upon him tooth and
nail&mdash;to use a phrase. Dora&#8217;s hand closed over
the grasshopper, and Ralston&#8217;s closed over Dora&#8217;s,
holding it tight in one confused moment of delicious,
tongue-tied silence.</p>
<p>Her shoulder touched his, her hair brushed his
cheek. He wished that they might go on holding
down that grasshopper until the end of time. She
was panting with the exertion, her nose was moist
like a baby&#8217;s when it sleeps, and he noticed in a
swift, sidelong glance that the pupils of her eyes
all but covered the iris.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&mdash;he&#8217;s wiggling!&#8221; she said tremulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he?&#8221; Ralston asked fatuously, at a loss for
words, but making no move to lift his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;And there&#8217;s a cactus in my finger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see it.&#8221; Immediately his face was full
of deep concern.</p>
<p>He held her fingers, turning the small pink
palm upward.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must get it out,&#8221; he declared firmly.
&#8220;They poison some people.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wondered if it was imagination, or did her
hand tremble a little in his? His relief was not
unmixed with disappointment when the cactus spine
came out easily.</p>
<p>&#8220;They hurt&mdash;those needles.&#8221; He continued to
regard the tiny puncture with unabated interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tra! la! la!&#8221; sang Susie from the brow of
the hill. &#8220;Old Smith is comin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralston dropped Dora&#8217;s hand, and they both
reddened, each wondering how long Susie had been
doing picket duty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out for your failin&#8217; health, Mister Smith?&#8221;
inquired Susie, with solicitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m huntin&#8217; horses, and hopin&#8217; to pick up a
bunch of ponies cheap,&#8221; he replied with ugly significance
as he rode by.</p>
<p>And while the soft light faded from Ralston&#8217;s
eyes, the color leaped to his face; unconsciously
his fists clenched as he looked after Smith&#8217;s vanishing
back. It was the latter&#8217;s first overt act of
hostility; Ralston knew, and perhaps Smith intended
it so, that the clash between them must
now come soon.</p>

<h3>MOTHER LOVE AND SAVAGE PASSION CONFLICT</h3>
</div>

<p>It was Sunday, a day later, when Susie came
into the living-room and noticed her mother sewing
muskrat around the top of a moccasin. It was
a man&#8217;s moccasin. The woman had made no men&#8217;s
moccasins since her husband&#8217;s death. The sight
chilled the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; she asked abruptly, &#8220;what do you
let that hold-up hang around here for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who you mean?&#8221; the woman asked quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That Smith!&#8221; Susie spat out the word like
something offensive.</p>
<p>The Indian woman avoided the girl&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like him,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he stay all time.&#8221; Her tone was stubborn,
as though she expected and was prepared to
resist an attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t&mdash;you <i>can&#8217;t</i>&mdash;mean it!&#8221;. Susie&#8217;s
thin face flushed scarlet with shame.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sa-ah,&#8221; the woman nodded, &#8220;I mean it;&#8221; and
Susie, staring at her in a kind of terror, saw that
she did.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother! Mother!&#8221; she cried passionately,
dropping on the floor at the woman&#8217;s feet and
clasping her arms convulsively about the Indian
woman&#8217;s knees. &#8220;Don&#8217;t&mdash;don&#8217;t say that! We&#8217;ve
always been a little different from the rest. We&#8217;ve
always held our heads up. People like us and
respect us&mdash;both Injuns and white. We&#8217;ve never
been talked about&mdash;you and me&mdash;and now you are
going to spoil it all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I get tied up to him right,&#8221; defended the
woman sullenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother!&#8221; wailed the child.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need good white man to run de ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But <i>Smith</i>&mdash;do you think <i>he&#8217;s</i> good? Good!
Is a rattlesnake good? Can&#8217;t you see what he is,
Mother?&mdash;you who are smarter than me in seeing
through people? He&#8217;s mean&mdash;onery to the marrow&mdash;and
some day sure&mdash;<i>sure</i>&mdash;he&#8217;ll turn, and
strike his fangs into you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He no onery,&#8221; the woman replied, in something
like anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s his nature,&#8221; Susie went on, without heeding
her. &#8220;He can&#8217;t help it. All his thoughts and
talk and schemes are about something crooked.
Can&#8217;t you tell by the things he lets drop that he
ought to be in the &#8217;pen&#8217;? He&#8217;s treacherous, ungrateful,
a born thief. I saw him take Tubbs&#8217;s
halter, and there was the regular thief look in
his eyes when he cut his own name on it. I saw
him kick a dog, and he kicked it like a brute. He
kicked it in the ribs with his toe. Men&mdash;decent
men&mdash;kick a dog with the side of their foot. I
saw his horse fall with him, and he held it down
and beat it on the neck with a chain, where it
wouldn&#8217;t show. He&#8217;d hold up a bank or rob a
woman; he&#8217;d kill a man or a prairie-dog, and think
no more of the one than the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, Mother, as sure as I sit here on
the floor at your feet, begging you, he&#8217;s going to
bring us trouble; he&#8217;s going to deal us misery!
I feel it! I <i>know</i> it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You no like de white man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right; I don&#8217;t like the white man. He
wants a good place to stay; he wants your horses
and cattle and hay; and&mdash;he wants the Schoolmarm.
He&#8217;s making a fool of you, Mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He no make fool of me,&#8221; she answered complacently.
&#8220;He make fool of de white woman,
maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out of the window and see for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>They arose together, and the girl pointed to
Smith and Dora, seated side by side on the cottonwood
log.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he ever look at you like that, Mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He make fool of de white woman,&#8221; she reiterated
stubbornly, but her face clouded.</p>
<p>&#8220;He makes a fool of himself, but not of her,&#8221;
declared Susie. &#8220;He&#8217;s crazy about her&mdash;locoed.
Everybody sees it except her. Believe me, Mother,
listen to Susie just this once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He like me. I stick to him;&#8221; but she went
back to her bench. The unfamiliar softness of
Smith&#8217;s face hurt her.</p>
<p>The tears filled Susie&#8217;s eyes and ran down her
cheeks. Her mother&#8217;s passion for this hateful
stranger was stronger than her mother-love, that
silent, undemonstrative love in which Susie had believed
as she believed that the sun would rise each
morning over there in the Bad Lands, to warm
her when she was cold. She buried her face in
her mother&#8217;s lap and sobbed aloud.</p>
<p>The woman had not seen Susie cry since she
was a tiny child, save when her father and White
Antelope died, and the numbed maternal instinct
stirred in her breast. She laid her dark, ringed
fingers upon Susie&#8217;s hair and stroked it gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry,&#8221; she said slowly. &#8220;If he make fool
of me, if he lie when he say he tie up to me right,
if he like de white woman better den me, I kill
him. I kill him, Susie.&#8221; She pointed to a bunch
of roots and short dried stalks which hung from
the rafters in one corner of the room. &#8220;See&mdash;that
is the love-charm of the Sioux. It was gifted
to me by Little Coyote&#8217;s woman&mdash;a Mandan. It
bring de love, and too much&mdash;it kill. If he make
fool of me, if he not like me better den de white
woman, I give him de love-charm of de Sioux. I
fix him! <i>I fix him right!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Out on the cottonwood log Smith and the Schoolmarm
had been speaking of many things; for
the man could talk fluently in his peculiar vernacular,
upon any subject which interested him or
with which he was familiar.</p>
<p>The best of his nature, whatever of good there
was in him, was uppermost when with Dora. He
really believed at such times that he was what
she thought him, and he condemned the shortcomings
of others like one speaking from the
lofty pinnacle of unimpeachable virtue.</p>
<p>In her presence, new ambitions, new desires,
awakened, and sentiments which he never had suspected
he possessed revealed themselves. He was
happy in being near her; content when he felt
the touch of her loose cape on his arm.</p>
<p>It never before had occurred to Smith that the
world through which he had gone his tumultuous
way was a beautiful place, or that there was joy
in the simple fact of being strongly alive. When
the sage-brush commenced to turn green and the
many brilliant flowers of the desert bloomed, when
the air was stimulating like wine and fragrant with
the scents of spring, it had meant little to Smith
beyond the facts that horse-feed would soon be
plentiful and that he could lay aside his Mackinaw
coat. The mountains suggested nothing but that
they held big game and were awkward places to
get through on horseback, while the deserts brought
no thoughts save of thirst and loneliness and choking
alkali dust. Upon a time a stranger had mentioned
the scenery, and Smith had replied ironically
that there was plenty of it and for him to help
himself!</p>
<p>But this spring was different&mdash;so different that
he asked himself wonderingly if other springs had
been like it; and to-day, as he sat in the sunshine
and looked about him, he saw for the first
time grandeur in the saw-toothed, snow-covered
peaks outlined against the dazzling blue of the
western sky. For the first time he saw the awing
vastness of the desert, and the soft pastel shades
which made their desolation beautiful. He breathed
deep of the odorous air and stared about him like
a blind man who suddenly sees.</p>
<p>During a silence, Smith looked at Dora with his
curiously intent gaze; his characteristic stare which
held nothing of impertinence&mdash;only interest, intense,
absorbing interest&mdash;and as he looked a
thought came to him, a thought so unexpected, so
startling, that he blinked as if some one had struck
him in the face. It sent a bright red rushing over
him, coloring his neck, his ears, his white, broad
forehead.</p>
<p>He thought of her as the mother of children&mdash;his
children&mdash;bearing his name, miniatures of himself
and of her. He never had thought of this
before. He never had met a woman who inspired
in him any such desire. He followed the thought
further. What if he should have a permanent
home&mdash;a ranch that belonged to him exclusively&mdash;&#8220;Smith&#8217;s
Ranch&#8221;&mdash;where there were white curtains
at the windows, and little ones who came
tumbling through the door to greet him when
he rode into the yard? A place where people
came to visit, people who reckoned him a person
of consequence because he stood for something.
He must have seen a place like it somewhere, the
picture was so vivid in his mind.</p>
<p>The thought of living like others never before
had entered into the scheme of his calculations.
Since the time when he had &#8220;quit the flat&#8221; back
in the country where they slept between sheets,
the world had been lined up against him in its
own defense. Life had been a constant game of
hare and hounds, with the pack frequently close
at his heels. He had been ever on the move, both
for reasons of safety and as a matter of taste. His
point of view was the abnormal one of the professional
law-breaker: the world was his legitimate
prey; the business of his life was to do as he
pleased and keep his liberty; to outwit sheriffs and
make a clean get-away. To be known among his
kind as &#8220;game&#8221; and &#8220;slick,&#8221; was the only distinction
he craved. His chiefest ambition had been
to live up to his title of &#8220;Bad Man.&#8221; In this he
had found glory which satisfied him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Dora asked at last, smiling up at him,
&#8220;what is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith hesitated; then he burst out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl, do I stack up different to you nor anybody
else? Have you any feelin&#8217; for me at all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I think I&#8217;ve shown my interest in trying
to teach you,&#8221; she replied, a little abashed by
his vehemence.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to teach me for?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; Dora declared, &#8220;you have possibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you teach Meeteetse Ed and
Tubbs?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dora laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Candidly, I think it would be a waste of time.
They could never hope to be much more than we
see them here. And they are content as they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So was I, girl, until our trails crossed. I could
ride without grub all day, and sing. I could sleep
on a saddle-blanket like a tired pup, with only a
rock for a wind-break and my saddle for a pillow.
Now I can&#8217;t sleep in a bed. It&#8217;s horrible&mdash;this
mixed up feelin&#8217;&mdash;half the time wantin&#8217; to holler
and laugh and the other half wantin&#8217; to cry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you should feel like that,&#8221;
said Dora gravely. &#8220;You are getting along. It&#8217;s
slow, but you&#8217;re learning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;m learnin&#8217;,&#8221; Smith answered grimly&mdash;&#8220;fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw her wondering look and went on fiercely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl, don&#8217;t you see what I mean? Don&#8217;t you
<i>sabe</i>? My feelin&#8217; for you is more nor friendship.
I can&#8217;t tell you how I feel. It&#8217;s nothin&#8217; I ever
had before, but I&#8217;ve heard of it a-plenty. It&#8217;s
love&mdash;that&#8217;s what it is! I&#8217;ve seen it, too, a-plenty.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s two things in the world a feller&#8217;ll go
through hell for&mdash;just two: love and gold. I
don&#8217;t mean money, but gold&mdash;the pure stuff.
They&#8217;ll waller through snow-drifts, they&#8217;ll swim
rivers with the ice runnin&#8217;, they&#8217;ll crawl through
canyons and over trails on their hands and knees,
they&#8217;ll starve and they&#8217;ll freeze, they&#8217;ll work till
the blood runs from their blistered hands, they&#8217;ll
kill their horses and their pardners, for gold!
And they&#8217;ll do it for love. Yes, I&#8217;ve seen it a-plenty,
me&mdash;Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things I&#8217;ve done, I&#8217;ve done, and they don&#8217;t
worry me none,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;but lately I&#8217;ve
thought of Dutch Joe. I worked him over for
singin&#8217; a love-song, and I wisht I hadn&#8217;t. He&#8217;d
held up a stage, and was cached in my camp till
things simmered down. It was lonesome, and I&#8217;d
want to talk; but he&#8217;d sit back in the dark, away
from the camp-fire, and sing to himself about
&#8217;ridin&#8217; to Annie.&#8217; How the miles wasn&#8217;t long or
the trail rough if only he was &#8217;ridin&#8217; to Annie.&#8217;
Sittin&#8217; back there in the brush, he sounded like
a sick coyote a-hollerin&#8217;. It hadn&#8217;t no tune, and
I thought it was the damnedest fool song I ever
heard. After he&#8217;d sung it more&#8217;n five hundred
times, I hit him on the head with a six-shooter,
and we mixed. He quit singin&#8217;, but he held that
gretch against me as long as he lived.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was because he was Dutch, but
it wasn&#8217;t. &#8217;Twas love. Why, girl, I&#8217;d ride as
long as my horse could stand up under me, and
then I&#8217;d hoof it, just to hear you say, &#8216;Smith,
do you think it will rain?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I never thought of this!&#8221; cried Dora,
as Smith paused.</p>
<p>Her face was full of distress, and her hands
lay tightly clenched in her lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean I haven&#8217;t any show&mdash;no show
at all?&#8221; The color fading from Smith&#8217;s face left
it a peculiar yellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;It never occurred to me that you would misunderstand,
or think anything but that I wanted
to help you. I thought that you wanted to learn
so that you would have a better chance in life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you&mdash;honest? Are you as innocent as
that, girl?&#8221; he asked in savage scepticism. &#8220;Did
you believe that I&#8217;d set and study them damned
verbs just so I&#8217;d have a better chanct in life?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, maybe I <i>said</i> so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely, <i>surely</i>, you don&#8217;t think I would intentionally
mislead you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When a woman wants a man to dress or act
or talk different, she generally cares some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I do &#8216;care some&#8217;!&#8221; Dora cried impulsively.
&#8220;I believe that you are not making the
best of yourself, of your life; that you are better
than your surroundings; and because I do believe
in you, I want to help you. Don&#8217;t you
understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her explanation was not convincing to Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it because I don&#8217;t talk grammar, and you
think you&#8217;d have to live in a log-house and hang
out your own wash?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dora considered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if I cared for you, those things would
have weight,&#8221; she answered truthfully. &#8220;I am
content out here now, and like it because it is
novel and I know it is temporary; but if I were
asked to live here always, as you suggest, in a
log-house and hang out my own wash, I should
have to care a great deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because I haven&#8217;t a stake, then,&#8221; he said
bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not because you haven&#8217;t a stake. I merely
say that extreme poverty would be an objection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if I should get the <i>dinero</i>&mdash;me, Smith&mdash;plenty
of it? Tell me,&#8221; he demanded fiercely&mdash;&#8220;it&#8217;s
the time to talk now&mdash;is there any one else?
It&#8217;s me for the devil straight if you throw me!
You&#8217;d better take this gun here, plant it on my
heart, and pull the trigger. Because if I live&mdash;I&#8217;m
talkin&#8217; straight&mdash;what I have done will be
just a kid&#8217;s play to what I&#8217;ll do, if I ever cut
loose for fair. Don&#8217;t throw me, girl! Give me
a show&mdash;if there ain&#8217;t any one else! If there is,
I&#8217;m quittin&#8217; the flat to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dora was silent, panic-stricken with the responsibility
which he seemed to have thrust upon
her, almost terrified by the thought that he was
leaving his future in her hands&mdash;a malleable object,
to be shaped according to her will for good
or evil.</p>
<p>A certain self-contained, spectacled youth, whose
weekly letters arrived with regularity, rose before
her mental vision, and as quickly vanished, leaving
in his stead a man of a different type, a man at
once unyielding and gentle, both shy and bold; a
man who seemed to typify in himself the faults
and virtues of the raw but vigorous West. Though
she hesitated, she replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, there is no one.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Ralston, fording the stream, lifted his eyes
midway and saw Smith raise Dora&#8217;s hand to his
lips.</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<h2>XI</h2>
<h3>THE BEST HORSE</h3>
</div>

<p>There was a subtle change in Ralston, which
Dora was quick to feel. He was deferential, as
always, and as eager to please; but he no longer
sought her company, and she missed the quick
exchange of sympathetic glances at the table. It
seemed to her, also, that the grimness in his face
was accentuated of late. She found herself crying
one night, and called it homesickness, yet the
small items of news contained in the latest letter
from the spectacled youth had irritated her, and
she had realized that she no longer regarded church
fairs, choir practice, and oyster suppers as
&#8220;events.&#8221;</p>
<p>She wondered how she had offended Ralston, if
at all; or was it that he thought her bold, a
brazen creature, because she had let him keep her
hand so long upon the memorable occasion of the
grasshopper hunt? She blushed in the darkness
at the thought, and the tears slipped down her
cheeks again as she decided that this must be so,
since there could be no other explanation. Before
she finally slept, she had fully made up her mind
that she would show him by added reserve and
dignity of manner that she was not the forward
hoyden he undoubtedly believed her. And as a
result of this midnight decision, the Schoolmarm&#8217;s
&#8220;Good-morning, Mr. Ralston,&#8221; chilled that person
like a draught from cold storage.</p>
<p>Susie noticed the absence of their former cordiality
toward each other; and the obvious lack
of warmth filled Smith with keen satisfaction. He
had no notion of its cause; it was sufficient that
it was so.</p>
<p>As their conversation daily became more forced,
the estrangement more marked, Ralston&#8217;s wretchedness
increased in proportion. He brooded miserably
over the scene he had witnessed; troubled, aside
from his own interest in Dora, that she should be
misled by a man of Smith&#8217;s moral calibre. While he
had delighted in her unworldly, childlike belief in
people and things, in this instance he deeply regretted
it.</p>
<p>Ralston understood perfectly the part which
Smith desired to play in her eyes. He had heard
through Dora the stories Smith had told her of
wild adventures in which he figured to advantage,
of reckless deeds which he hinted would be impossible
since falling under her influence. He
posed as a brand snatched from the burning, and
conveyed the impression that his salvation was a
duty which had fallen in her path for her to perform.
That she applied herself to the task of
elevating Smith with such combined patience and
ardor, was the grievance of which Ralston had most
to complain.</p>
<p>In his darker moments he told himself that she
must have a liking for the man far stronger than
he had believed, to have permitted the liberty which
he had witnessed, one which, coming from Smith,
seemed little short of sacrilege. His unhappiness
was not lessened by the instances he recalled where
women had married beneath them through this
mistaken sense of duty, pity, or less commendable
emotions.</p>
<p>Upon one thing he was determined, and that
was never again to force his attentions upon her,
to take advantage of her helplessness as he had
when he had held her hand so tightly and, as he
now believed, against her wishes. Although she
did not show it, she must have thought him a bumpkin,
an oaf, an underbred cur. He groaned as he
ransacked his vocabulary for fitting words.</p>
<p>If only something would arise to reveal Smith&#8217;s
character to her in its true light! But this was
too much to hope. In his depression, it seemed
to Ralston that the sun would never shine for him
again, that failure was written on him like an I.&nbsp;D.
brand, that sorrow everlasting would eat and sleep
with him. In this mood, after a brief exchange
of breakfast civilities, far worse than none, he
walked slowly to the corral to saddle, cursing
Smith for the braggart he knew he was and for
the scoundrel he believed him to be.</p>
<p>Smith, it seemed, was riding that morning also,
for when Ralston led his brown mare saddled and
bridled from the stable, Smith was tightening the
cinch on his long-legged gray&mdash;the horse he had
taken from the Englishman. The Schoolmarm, in
her riding clothes, ran down the trail, calling impartially:</p>
<p>&#8220;Will one of you please get my horse for me?
He broke loose last night and is over there in the
pasture.&#8221;</p>
<p>For reply, both Ralston and Smith swung into
their saddles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I aims to get that horse. There&#8217;s no call
for you to go, feller.&#8221;</p>
<p>Above all else, it was odious to Ralston to be
addressed by Smith &#8220;feller.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you happen to get to him first,&#8221; he answered
curtly. &#8220;And I&#8217;d like to suggest that my
name is Ralston.&#8221;</p>
<p>By way of answer, Smith dug the spurs cruelly
into the thin-skinned blooded gray. Ralston
loosened the reins on his brown mare, and it was
a run from the jump.</p>
<p>Each realized that the inevitable clash had come,
that no pretense of friendliness would longer be
possible between them, that from now on they would
be avowed enemies. As for Ralston, he was glad
that the crisis had arrived; glad of anything
which would divert him for ever so short a time
from his own bitter thoughts; glad of the test
which he could meet in the open, like a man.</p>
<p>The corral gate was open, and this led into a
lane something like three-quarters of a mile in
length, at the end of which was another gate,
opening into the pasture where the runaway pony
had crawled through the loose wire fence.</p>
<p>The brown mare had responded to Ralston&#8217;s
signal like the loyal, honest little brute she was.
The gravel flew behind them, and the rat-a-tat-tat
of the horses&#8217; hoofs on the hard road was like the
roll of a drum. They were running neck and
neck, but Ralston had little fear of the result,
unless the gray had phenomenal speed.</p>
<p>Ralston knew that whoever reached the gate
first must open it. If he could get far enough in
the lead, he could afford to do so; if not, he
meant to &#8220;pull&#8221; his horse and leave it to Smith.
The real race would be from the gate to the pony.</p>
<p>The gray horse could run&mdash;his build showed
that, and his stride bore out his appearance. Yet
Ralston felt no uneasiness, for the mare had still
several links of speed to let out&mdash;&#8220;and then
some,&#8221; as he phrased it. The pace was furious
even to the gate; they ran neck and neck, like
a team, and the face of each rider was set in lines
of determination. Ralston quickly saw that in the
short stretch he would be unable to get sufficiently
in the lead to open the gate in safety. So he
pulled his horse a little, wondering if Smith would
do the same. But he did not. Instead, he spurred
viciously, and, to Ralston&#8217;s amazement, he went
at the gate hard. Lifting the gray horse&#8217;s head,
he went over and on without a break!</p>
<p>It was a chance, but Smith had taken it! He
never had tried the horse, but it was from the
English ranch, where he knew they were bred and
trained to jump. His mocking laugh floated back
to Ralston while he tore at the fastenings of the
gate and hurled it from him.</p>
<p>Ralston measured the gap between them and his
heart sank. It looked hopeless. The only thing
in his favor was that it was a long run, and the
gray might not have the wind or the endurance.
The little mare stood still, her nose out, her soft
eyes shining. As he lifted the reins, he patted
her neck and cried, breathing hard:</p>
<p>&#8220;Molly, old girl, if you win, it&#8217;s oats and a
rest all your life!&#8221;</p>
<p>He could have sworn the mare shared his
humiliation.</p>
<p>The saddle-leathers creaked beneath him at the
leap she gave. She lay down to her work like a
hound, running low, her neck outstretched, her
tail lying out on the breeze. Game, graceful, reaching
out with her slim legs and tiny hoofs, she
ate up the distance between herself and the gray
in a way that made even Ralston gasp. And still
she gained&mdash;and gained! Her muscles seemed like
steel springs, and the unfaltering courage in her
brave heart made Ralston choke with pride and
tenderness and gratitude. Even if she lost, the
race she was making was something to remember
always. But she was gaining inch by inch. The
sage-brush and cactus swam under her feet. When
Ralston thought she had done her best, given all
that was in her, she did a little more.</p>
<p>Smith knew, too, that she was gaining, though
he would not turn his head to look. When her
nose was at his horse&#8217;s rump, he had it in his heart
to turn and shoot her as she ran. She crept up
and up, and both Smith and Ralston knew that
the straining, pounding gray had done its best.
The work was too rough for its feet. There was
too much thoroughbred in it for lava-rock and sage-brush
hummocks. Blind rage consumed Smith as
he felt the increasing effort of each stride and
knew that it was going &#8220;dead&#8221; under him. He
used his spurs with savage brutality, but the brown
mare&#8217;s breath was coming hot on his leg. The
gray horse stumbled; its breath came and went in
sobs. Now they were neck and neck again. Then
it was over, the little brown mare swept by, and
Ralston&#8217;s rope, cutting the air, dropped about the
neck of the insignificant, white &#8220;digger&#8221; that had
caused it all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re ridin&#8217; the best horse to-day,&#8221;
said Smith, as he dropped from the saddle to retie
his latigo.</p>
<p>He gave the words a peculiar emphasis and inflection
which made the other man look at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Molly and I have a prejudice against taking
dust,&#8221; Ralston answered quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It happens frequent that a feller has to get
over his prejudices out in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends a little upon the fellow;&#8221; and
he turned Molly&#8217;s head toward the ranch, with the
pony in tow.</p>
<p>Smith said nothing more, but rode off across
the hills with all the evil in his nature showing
in his lowering countenance.</p>
<p>Dora&#8217;s eyes were brilliant as they always were
under excitement; and when Ralston dismounted
she stroked Molly&#8217;s nose, saying in a voice which
was more natural than it had been for days when
addressing him, &#8220;It was splendid! <i>She</i> is splendid!&#8221;
and he glowed, feeling that perhaps he
was included a little in her praise.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to watch out now,&#8221; said Susie
soberly. &#8220;Smith&#8217;ll never rest till he&#8217;s &#8216;hunks.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralston thought the Schoolmarm hesitated, as
if she were waiting for him to join them, or were
going to ask him to do so; but she did not, and,
although it was some satisfaction to feel that he
had drawn first blood, he felt his despondency
returning as soon as Dora and Susie had ridden
away.</p>
<p>He walked aimlessly about, waiting for Molly
to cool a bit before he let her drink preparatory
to starting on his tiresome ride over the range.
Both he and the Colonel believed that the thieves
would soon grow bolder, and his strongest hope
lay in coming upon them at work. He had noted
that there were no fresh hides among those which
hung on the fence, and he sauntered down to have
another look at the old ones. With his foot
he turned over something which lay close against
a fence-post, half concealed in a sage-brush.
Stooping, he unrolled it and shook it out; then
he whistled softly. It was a fresh hide with the
brand cut out!</p>
<p>Ralston nodded his head in mingled satisfaction
and regret. So the thief was working from
the MacDonald ranch! Did the Indian woman
know, he wondered. Was it possible that Susie
was in ignorance? With all his heart, he hoped
she was. He walked leisurely to the house and
leaned against the jamb of the kitchen door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have the makings, Ling?&#8221; He passed his
tobacco-sack and paper to the cook.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221; said Ling jauntily. &#8220;I like &#8217;em
cigilette.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as they smoked fraternally together, they
talked of food and its preparation&mdash;subjects from
which Ling&#8217;s thoughts seldom wandered far. When
the advantages of soda and sour milk over baking
powder were thoroughly exhausted as a topic,
Ralston asked casually:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who killed your last beef, Ling? It&#8217;s hard
to beat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yellow Bird,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Him good
butcher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Ralston agreed; &#8220;I should say that
Yellow Bird was an uncommonly good butcher.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, after all, it was the Indians who were killing.
Ralston sauntered on to the bunk-house
to think it over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tubbs,&#8221; McArthur was saying, as he eyed
that person with an interest which he seldom bestowed
upon his hireling, &#8220;you really have a most
remarkable skull.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tubbs, visibly flattered, smirked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s claimed that it&#8217;s double by people what
have tried to work me over. Onct I crawled in
a winder and et up a batch of &#8217;son-of-a-gun-in-a-sack&#8217;
that the feller who lived there had jest
made. He come in upon me suddent, and the
way he hammered me over the head with the stove-lifter
didn&#8217;t trouble <i>him</i>, but,&#8221; declared Tubbs
proudly, &#8220;he never even knocked me to my
knees.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is of the type of dolichocephalic,&#8221; mused
McArthur.</p>
<p>&#8220;A barber told me that same thing the last
time I had a hair-cut,&#8221; observed Tubbs blandly.
&#8220;&#8216;Tubbs,&#8217; says he, &#8216;you ought to have a massaj
every week, and lay the b&#8217;ar-ile on a-plenty.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is remarkably suggestive of the skulls found
in the ancient paraderos of Patagonia. Very
similar in contour&mdash;very similar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no Irish in me,&#8221; Tubbs declared with
a touch of resentment. &#8220;I&#8217;m pure mungrel&mdash;English
and Dutch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an extremely curious skull&mdash;most peculiar.&#8221;
He felt of Tubbs&#8217;s head with growing interest.
&#8220;This bump behind the ear, if the system
of phrenology has any value, would indicate unusual
pugnacity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where a mule kicked me and put his
laig out of joint,&#8221; said Tubbs humorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that renders the skull pathological; but,
even so, it is an interesting skull to an anthropologist&mdash;a
really valuable skull, it would be to
me, illustrating as it does certain features in dispute,
for which I have stubbornly contended in
controversies with the Preparator of Anthropology
at the École des Haute Études in Paris.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you sell it to him, Tubbs?&#8221; suggested
Ralston, who had listened in unfeigned
amusement.</p>
<p>Tubbs, startled, clasped both hands over the top
of his head and backed off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I need it myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly&mdash;we understand that; but supposing
you were to die&mdash;supposing something happened
to you, as is liable to happen out here&mdash;you
wouldn&#8217;t care what became of your skull, once
you were good and dead. If it were sold, you&#8217;d
be just that much in, besides making an invaluable
contribution to science,&#8221; Ralston urged persuasively.</p>
<p>&#8220;It not infrequently happens that paupers, and
prisoners sentenced to suffer capital punishment,
dispose of their bodies for anatomical purposes,
for which they are paid in advance. As a matter
of fact, Tubbs,&#8221; declared McArthur earnestly,
&#8220;my superficial examination of your head has so
impressed me that upon the chance of some day
adding it to my collection I am willing to offer
you a reasonable sum for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s on bi-products that the money is made,&#8221;
declared Ralston soberly, &#8220;and I advise you not
to let this chance pass. You can raise money
on the rest of your anatomy any time; but selling
your head separately like this&mdash;don&#8217;t miss it,
Tubbs!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I git the money till you git my head?&#8221;
Tubbs demanded suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could make a first payment to you, and
the remainder could be paid to your heirs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My heirs! Say, all that I&#8217;ll ever git for my
head wouldn&#8217;t be a smell amongst my heirs. A
round-up of my heirs would take in the hull of
North Dakoty. Not aimin&#8217; to brag, I got mavericks
runnin&#8217; on that range what must be twelve-year-old.&#8221;</p>
<p>McArthur looked the disgust he felt at Tubbs&#8217;s
ribald humor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your jests are exceedingly distasteful to me,
Tubbs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t no jest. Onct I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get down to business,&#8221; interrupted
Ralston. &#8220;What do you consider your skull
worth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wuth considerable to me. I don&#8217;t know
as I&#8217;m so turrible anxious to sell. I can eat
with it, and it gits me around.&#8221; Tubbs&#8217;s tone
took on the assumed indifference of an astute
horse trader. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always held my head high, as
you might say, and it looks to me like it ought to
bring a hunderd dollars in the open market. No,
I couldn&#8217;t think of lettin&#8217; it go for less than a
hundred&mdash;cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>McArthur considered.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will agree to my conditions, I will give
you my check for one hundred dollars,&#8221; he said
at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds reasonable,&#8221; Tubbs assented.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should want you to carry constantly upon
your person my name, address, and written instructions
as to the care of and disposal of your
skull, in the event of your demise. I shall also
insist that you do not voluntarily place your head
where your skull may be injured; because, as you
can readily see, if it were badly crushed, it would
be worthless for my purpose, or that of the scientific
body to whom I intend to bequeath my interest
in it, should I die before yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t aimin&#8217; to lay it in a vise,&#8221; remarked
Tubbs.</p>
<p>While McArthur was drawing up the agreement
between them, Tubbs&#8217;s face brightened with a
unique thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you leave
word in them instructions for me to be mounted?
I know a taxidermist over there near the Yellowstone
Park what can put up a b&#8217;ar or a timber
wolf so natural you wouldn&#8217;t know &#8217;twas dead.
Wouldn&#8217;t it be kinda nice to see me settin&#8217; around
the house with my teeth showin&#8217; and an ear of corn
in my mouth? I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ll do: I&#8217;ll sell
you my hull hide for a hundred more. It might
cost two dollars to have me tanned, and with a
nice felt linin&#8217; you could have a good rug out of
me for a very little money.&#8221;</p>
<p>McArthur replied ironically:</p>
<p>&#8220;I never have regarded you as an ornament,
Tubbs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tubbs looked at the check McArthur handed
him, with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I call clear velvet!&#8221; he declared,
and went off chuckling to show it to his friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you think of it, this is a very singular
transaction,&#8221; observed McArthur, wiping his fountain-pen
carefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; and Ralston, no longer able to contain
himself, shouted with laughter; &#8220;it is.&#8221;</p>

<h3>SMITH GETS &#8220;HUNKS&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Smith&#8217;s ugly mood was still upon him when he
picked up his grammar that evening. Jealous,
humiliated by the loss of the morning&#8217;s race, full
of revengeful thoughts and evil feelings, he wanted
to hurt somebody&mdash;something&mdash;even Dora. He
had a vague, sullen notion that she was to blame
because Ralston was in love with her. She could
have discouraged him in the beginning, he told
himself; she could have stopped it.</p>
<p>Unaccustomed as Smith was to self-restraint,
he quickly showed his frame of mind to Dora.
He had no <i>savoir faire</i> with which to conceal his
mood; besides, he entertained a feeling of proprietorship
over her which justified his resentment
to himself. Was she not to be his? Would he
not eventually control her, her actions, choose her
friends?</p>
<p>Dora found him a dense and disagreeable pupil,
and one who seemingly had forgotten everything
he had learned during previous lessons. His replies
at times were so curt as to be uncivil, and
a feeling of indignation gradually rose within her.
She was at a loss to understand his mood, unless
it was due to the result of the morning&#8217;s race;
yet she could scarcely believe that his disappointment,
perhaps chagrin, could account for his rudeness
to her.</p>
<p>When the useless lesson was finished, she closed
the book and asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not yourself to-night. What is
wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>With an expression upon his face which both
startled and shocked her he snarled:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sick of seein&#8217; that lady-killer hangin&#8217;
around here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ralston!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dora had never looked at Smith as she looked
at him now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg to be excused from your criticisms of
Mr. Ralston.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith had not dreamed that the gentle, girlish
voice could take on such a quality. It cut him,
stung him, until he felt hot and cold by turns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t know he was such a friend,&#8221; he
sneered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8221;&mdash;her eyes did not quail before the look
that flamed in his&mdash;&#8220;he is <i>just</i> such a friend!&#8221;</p>
<p>They had risen; and Smith, looking at her
as she stood erect, her head high in defiance, could
have choked her in his jealous rage.</p>
<p>He stumbled rather than walked toward the
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; he said in a strained, throaty
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stared at the door as it closed behind him.
She had something of the feeling of one who, making
a pet of a tiger, feels its claws for the first
time, sees the first indication of its ferocious
nature. This new phase of Smith&#8217;s character,
while it angered, also filled her with uneasiness.</p>
<p>It was later than usual when Smith came in to
say a word to the Indian woman, after Dora and
Susie had retired. He did not bring with him the
fumes of tobacco, the smoke of which rose in
clouds in the bunk-house, making it all but impossible
to see the length of the building; he
brought, rather, an odor of freshness, a feeling of
coolness, as though he had been long in the night
air.</p>
<p>The Indian woman sniffed imperceptibly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you been?&#8221;</p>
<p>His look was evil as he answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? I&#8217;ve been payin&#8217; my debts, me&mdash;Smith.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took her impassive hand in both of his and
pressed it against his heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prairie Flower,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want you to tell
Ralston to go. <i>I hate him</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman looked at him, but did not answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I tell him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;</p>
<p>She raised her narrowing eyes to his.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>When you tell de white woman to go</i>.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Ralston had felt that the old Colonel was growing
impatient with his seeming inactivity, so he decided,
the next morning, to ride to the Bar C and tell him
that he believed he had a clue. It would not be
necessary to keep Running Rabbit under close surveillance
until the beef in the meat-house was
getting low. Then the deputy sheriff meant not
to let him out of his sight.</p>
<p>Smith had not spoken to the man whom he had
come to regard as his rival since he had ridden
away from him the morning before. He had ignored
Ralston&#8217;s conversation at the table and avoided
him in the bunk-house. Now, engaged in trimming
his horse&#8217;s fetlocks, Smith did not look up
as the other man passed, but his eyes followed him
with a triumphant gleam as he went into the stable
to saddle Molly.</p>
<p>Ralston backed the mare to turn her in the stall,
and she all but fell down. He felt a little surprise
at her clumsiness, but did not grasp its meaning
until he led her to the door, where she stepped
painfully over the low door-sill and all but fell
again. He led her a step or two further, and she
went almost to her knees. The mare was lame in
every leg&mdash;she could barely stand; yet there was
not a mark on her&mdash;not ever so slight a bruise!
Her slender legs were as free from swellings as
when they had carried her past Smith&#8217;s gray; her
feet looked to be in perfect condition; yet, save
for the fact that she could stand up, she was as
crippled as if the bones of every leg were shattered.</p>
<p>It is doubtful if any but steel-colored eyes can
take on the look which Ralston&#8217;s contained as they
met Smith&#8217;s. His skin was gray as he straightened
himself and drew a hand which shook noticeably
the length of his cheek and across his mouth.</p>
<p>In great anger, anger which precedes some quick
and desperate act, almost every person has some
gesture peculiar to himself, and this was Ralston&#8217;s.</p>
<p>A less guilty man than Smith might have flinched
at that moment. The half-grin on his face faded,
and he waited for a torrent of accusations and
oaths. But Ralston, in a voice so low that it
barely reached him, a voice so ominous, so fraught
with meaning, that the dullest could not have misunderstood,
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll borrow your horse, Smith.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith, like one hypnotized, heard himself saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! Take him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralston knew as well as though he had witnessed
the act that Smith had hammered the frogs
of Molly&#8217;s feet until they were bruised and sore as
boils. Her lameness would not be permanent&mdash;she
would recover in a week or two; but the abuse of,
the cruelty to, the little mare he loved filled Ralston
with a hatred for Smith as relentless and deep as
Smith&#8217;s own.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man who could do a thing like that,&#8221; said
Ralston through his set teeth, &#8220;is no common cur!
He&#8217;s wolf&mdash;all wolf! He isn&#8217;t staying here for
love, alone. There&#8217;s something else. And I swear
before the God that made me, I&#8217;ll find out what
it is, and land him, before I quit!&#8221;</p>

<h3>SUSIE&#8217;S INDIAN BLOOD</h3>
</div>

<p>Coming leisurely up the path from the corrals,
Smith saw Susie sitting on the cottonwood log,
wrapped in her mother&#8217;s blanket. She was huddled
in a squaw&#8217;s attitude. He eyed her; he never had
seen her like that before. But, knowing Indians
better, possibly, than he knew his own race, Smith
understood. He recognized the mood. Her Indian
blood was uppermost. It rose in most half-breeds
upon occasion. Sometimes under the influence
of liquor it cropped out, sometimes anger
brought it to the surface. He had seen it often&mdash;this
heavy, smouldering sullenness.</p>
<p>Smith stood with his hands in his pockets, looking
at her. He felt more at ease with her than
ever before.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you sullin&#8217; about, Susie?&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer. Her pertness, her Anglo-Saxon
vivacity, were gone; her face was wooden,
expressionless; her restless eyes slow-moving and
dull; her cheek-bones, always noticeably high,
looked higher, and her skin was murky and dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look like a squaw with that sull on,&#8221; he
ventured again, and there was satisfaction in his
face.</p>
<p>It was something to know that, after all, Susie
was &#8220;Injun&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;pure Injun.&#8221; The scheme which
had lain dormant in his brain now took active shape.
He had wanted Susie&#8217;s help, but each time that he
had tried to conciliate her, his overtures had ended
in a fresh rupture. Now her stinging tongue was
dumb, and there was no aggressiveness in her
manner.</p>
<p>Smith, laying his hand heavily upon her shoulder,
sat down beside her, and a flash, a transitory gleam,
shone for an instant in her dull eyes; but she
did not move or change expression.</p>
<p>He said in a low voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;What you need is stirrin&#8217; up, Susie.&#8221;</p>
<p>He watched her narrowly, and continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to get into a game that has some
ginger in it. This here life is too tame for a girl
like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without looking at him she asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of a game?&#8221; Her voice was lifeless,
guttural.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s agin my principles to empty my sack to
a woman; but you&#8217;re diff&#8217;rent&mdash;you&#8217;re game&mdash;you
are, Susie.&#8221; His voice dropped to a whisper, and
the weight of his hand made her shoulder sag.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s you and me rustle a bunch of horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie did not betray surprise at the startling
proposition by so much as the twitching of an
eyelid.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Just for the hell of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>She grunted, but neither in assent nor dissent;
so Smith went on in an eager, persuasive whisper:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Injun enough in you, girl, to make
horse-stealin&#8217; all the same as breathin&#8217;. You jump
in with me on this deal and see how easy you lose
that sull. Don&#8217;t you ever have a feelin&#8217; take holt
of you that you want to do something onery&mdash;steal
something, mix with somebody? I do. I&#8217;ve had
that notorious feelin&#8217; workin&#8217; on me strong for days
now, and I&#8217;ve got to get rid of it. If you&#8217;ll come
in on this, we&#8217;ll have the excitement and make a
stake, too. Talk up, girl&mdash;show your sand! Be
game!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What horses do you aim to steal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reservation horses. Say, the way I can burn
their brands and fan &#8217;em over the line won&#8217;t trouble
<i>me</i>. I&#8217;ll come back with a wad&mdash;me, Smith&mdash;and
I&#8217;ll whack up even. What do you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for a hand do I take in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>A smile of triumph lifted the corners of Smith&#8217;s
mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;You gather &#8217;em up and run &#8217;em into a coulee,
that&#8217;s all. I&#8217;ll do the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want <i>me</i> to do it for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody&#8217;d think anything of it if they saw
you runnin&#8217; horses, because you&#8217;re always doin&#8217; it;
but they&#8217;d notice me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the coulee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve picked it. I located my plant long ago.
I&#8217;ve found the best spot in the State to make a
plant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you goin&#8217; to sell?&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith eyed her inscrutable face suspiciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re askin&#8217; lots of questions, girl. I tips
my hand too far to no petticoat. You trusts me
or you don&#8217;t. Will you come in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Susie after a silence; &#8220;I&#8217;ll
come in&mdash;&#8216;just for the hell of it.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shake!&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at his extended hand and wrapped
her own in her blanket.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no call to shake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your heart mixed, Susie?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it right toward me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be right enough when the time comes,&#8221;
she answered.</p>
<p>The reply did not satisfy Smith, but he told
himself that, once she was committed, he could
manage her, for, after all, Susie was little more
than a child. Smith felt uncommonly pleased with
himself for his bold stroke.</p>
<p>The new intimacy between Smith and Susie, the
sudden cessation of hostilities, caused surprise on
the ranch, but the Indian woman was the only one
to whom it gave pleasure. She viewed the altered
relations with satisfaction, since it removed the only
obstacle, as she believed, to a speedy marriage with
Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you he smart white man?&#8221; she
asked complacently of Susie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, he&#8217;s awful smart,&#8221; Susie answered
with sarcasm.</p>
<p>Ralston, more than any one else, was puzzled
by their apparent friendship. He had believed that
Susie&#8217;s antipathy for Smith was as deep as his
own, and he wondered what could have happened
to bring about such a sudden and complete revulsion
of feeling. He was disappointed in her.
He felt that she had weakly gone over to the
enemy; and it shook his confidence in her sturdy
honesty more than anything she could have done.
He believed that no person who understood Smith,
as Susie undoubtedly did, could make a friend and
confidant of him and be &#8220;right.&#8221; But sometimes
he caught Susie&#8217;s eyes fixed upon him in a kind
of wistful, inquiring scrutiny, which left the impression
that something was troubling her, something
that she longed to confide in some one upon
whom she could rely; but his past experience had
taught him the futility of attempting to force her
confidence, of trying to learn more than she volunteered.</p>
<p>Smith and Susie rode the surrounding country
and selected horses from the various bands. Three
or four bore Bear Chief&#8217;s brand, there were a
pinto and a black buckskin in Running Rabbit&#8217;s
herd, and a sorrel or two that belonged to Yellow
Bird. A couple of bays here were singled out,
a brown and black there, until they had the pick
of the range.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to get more nor you can cut
out alone and handle,&#8221; warned Smith. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
want no slip-up on the start.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t aim to make no slip-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got lookers, we have,&#8221; declared Smith.
&#8220;And them chunky ones go off quickest at a forced
sale. I know a horse when I meet up with it, me&mdash;Smith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where you goin&#8217; to cache &#8217;em?&#8221; insisted
Susie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl, I ain&#8217;t been ridin&#8217; this range for my
health. I&#8217;ll show you a blind canyon where a regiment
of soldiers couldn&#8217;t find a hundred head of
horses in a year; and over there in the Bad Lands
there&#8217;s a spring breakin&#8217; out where a man dyin&#8217;
of thirst would never think of lookin&#8217; for it. We&#8217;re
all right. You&#8217;re a head-worker, and so am I.&#8221;
Smith chuckled. &#8220;We&#8217;ll set some of these Injuns
afoot, and make a clean-get-away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith was more than satisfied with the zest with
which Susie now entered into the plot, and the
shrewdness which she showed in planning details
that he himself had overlooked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You work along with me, kid, and I&#8217;ll make
a dead-game one out of you!&#8221; he declared with
enthusiasm. &#8220;When we make a stake, we&#8217;ll go
to Billings and rip up the sod!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll like that,&#8221; said Susie dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the right time comes, I&#8217;ll know it,&#8221; Smith
went on. &#8220;When I wakes up some mornin&#8217; with
a feelin&#8217; that it&#8217;s the day to get action on, I
always follows that feelin&#8217;&mdash;if it takes holt of me
anyways strong. I has to do certain things on
certain days. I hates a chilly day worse nor anything.
I wants to hole up, and I feels mean enough
to bite myself. But when the sun shines, it thaws
me; it draws the frost out of my heart, like.
I hates to let anybody&#8217;s blood when the sun shines.
I likes to lie out on a rock like a lizard, and I
feels kind. I&#8217;m cur&#8217;ous that way, about sun, me&mdash;Smith.&#8221;</p>

<h3>THE SLAYER OF MASTODONS</h3>
</div>

<p>Dora and Susie had planned to botanize one
fine Saturday morning, and Susie, dressed for a
tramp in the hills, was playing with a pup in the
dooryard, waiting for Dora, when she saw Smith
coming toward her with the short, quick step which,
she had learned, with him denoted mental activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the day for it,&#8221; he said decisively.
&#8220;I had that notorious feelin&#8217; take holt of me when
I got awake. How&#8217;s your heart, girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>It had given a thump at Smith&#8217;s approach, and
Susie&#8217;s tawny skin had paled under its tan, but by
way of reply she gave the suggestive Indian sign
of strength.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; he nodded. &#8220;You&#8217;ll need a strong
heart for the ridin&#8217; you&#8217;ve got to do to-day; but
I&#8217;m not a worryin&#8217; that you can&#8217;t do it, kid, for
I&#8217;ve watched you close.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I could ride a flyin&#8217; squirrel if I had to,&#8221;
Susie replied shortly, &#8220;but Teacher wanted me to
go with her to get flowers. She doesn&#8217;t like to
go alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no call for her to go alone. I&#8217;ll go
with her. It&#8217;s no use for me to get to the plant
before afternoon. I&#8217;ll go on this flower-pickin&#8217;
spree, and be at the mouth of the canyon in time
to hold the first bunch of horses you bring in.
They&#8217;re pretty much scattered, you know. What
for an outfit you goin&#8217; to wear? You don&#8217;t want
no flappin&#8217; skirts to advertise you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie answered curtly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I got some sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a sassy side-kicker,&#8221; he observed good-humoredly.</p>
<p>She pouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care, I wanted to pick flowers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith said mockingly, &#8220;So do I, angel child. I
jest worships flowers!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From pickin&#8217; flowers to stealin&#8217; horses is some
of a jump.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I holds a record for long jumps.&#8221; As a final
warning Smith said: &#8220;Now, don&#8217;t make no mistake
in cuttin&#8217; out, for we&#8217;ve picked the top horses
of the range. And remember, once you get &#8217;em
strung out, haze &#8217;em along&mdash;for there&#8217;ll be hell
a-poppin&#8217; on the reservation when they&#8217;re missed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie had disappeared when the Schoolmarm came
out with her basket and knife, prepared to start,
and Smith gave some plausible excuse for her
change of plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;She told me to go in her place,&#8221; said Smith
eagerly, &#8220;and I know a gulch where there&#8217;s a
barrel of them Mormon lilies, and rock-roses, and
a reg&#8217;lar carpet of these here durn little blue
flowers that look so nice and smell like a Chinese
laundry. I can dig like a badger, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dora laughed, and, looking at him, noticed, as
she often had before, the wonderful vividness with
which his varying moods were reflected in his face,
completely altering his expression.</p>
<p>He looked boyish, brimming with the buoyant
spirits of youth. His skin had unwonted clearness,
his eyes were bright, his face was animated;
he seemed to radiate exuberant good-humor. Even
his voice was different and his laugh was less hard.
As he walked away with the Schoolmarm&#8217;s basket
swinging on his arm, he was for the time what he
should have been always. He had long since made
ample apology to Dora for his offense and there
had been no further outbreak from him of which
to complain.</p>
<p>The day&#8217;s work was cut out for Ralston also,
when he saw Yellow Bird and another Indian ride
away, each leading a pack-horse, and learned from
Ling that they had gone to butcher. They started
off over the reservation, in the direction in which
the MacDonald cattle ranged; with the intention,
Ralston supposed, of circling and coming out on
the Bar C range. He thought that by keeping
well to the draws and gulches he could remain fairly
well hidden and yet keep them in sight.</p>
<p>He heard voices, and turned a hill just in time
to see Smith take a flower gently from Dora&#8217;s
hand and, with some significant word, lay it with
care between the leaves of a pocket note-book.</p>
<p>Though it looked more to Ralston, all that Smith
had said was, &#8220;It might bring me luck.&#8221; And
Dora had smiled at his superstition.</p>
<p>Ralston would have turned back had it not been
too late: his horse&#8217;s feet among the rocks had
caused them to look up. As he passed Dora replied
to some commonplace, with heightened color,
and Smith stared in silent triumph.</p>
<p>Ralston cursed himself and the mischance which
had taken him to that spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll think I was spying upon her, like some
ignorant, jealous fool!&#8221; he told himself savagely.
&#8220;Why, why, is it that I must always blunder
upon such scenes, to make me miserable for days!
Can it be&mdash;can it possibly be,&#8221; he asked himself&mdash;&#8220;that
she cares for the man; that she encourages
him; that she has a foolish, Quixotic notion that
she can raise him to her own level?&#8221;</p>
<p>Was there really good in the man which he,
Ralston, was unable to see? Was he too much
in love with Dora himself to be just to Smith,
he wondered.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; he reiterated vehemently. &#8220;No man
who would abuse a horse is fit for a good woman
to marry. I&#8217;m right about him&mdash;I know I am.
But can I prove it in time to save her?&mdash;not for
myself, for I guess I&#8217;ve no show; but from him?&#8221;</p>
<p>With a heartache which seemed to have become
chronic of late, Ralston followed the Indians&#8217; lead
up hill and down, through sand coulees and between
cut-banks, at a leisurely pace. They seemed
in no hurry, nor did they make any apparent effort
to conceal themselves. They rode through several
herds of cattle, and passed on, drifting gradually
toward the creek bottom close to the reservation
line, where both Bar C and I.&nbsp;D. cattle came to
drink.</p>
<p>Ralston wondered if they would attempt to stand
him off; but his heart was too heavy for the possibility
of a coming fight to quicken his pulse to
any great extent. He believed that he would be
rather glad than otherwise if they should make a
stand. The thought that the tedious waiting game
which he had played so long might be ended did
not elate him. The ambition seemed to have gone
out of him. He had little heart in his work, and
small interest in the glory resulting from success.</p>
<p>He thought only of Dora as he lay full length
on the ground, plucking disconsolately at spears
of bunch-grass within reach, while he waited for
the sound of a shot in the creek bottom, or the
reappearance of the Indians.</p>
<p>He had not long to wait before a shot, a bellow,
and another shot told him that the time for action
had come. He pulled his rifle from its scabbard,
and laid it in front of him on his saddle. It was
curious, he thought, as he rode closer, that one
Indian was not on guard. Still, it was probable
that they had grown careless through past successes.
He was within a hundred yards of the
butchers before they saw him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; Yellow Bird&#8217;s voice was friendly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; Ralston answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fat cow. Fine beef,&#8221; vouchsafed the Indian.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine beef,&#8221; agreed Ralston. &#8220;Can I help
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The MacDonald brand stood out boldly on the
cow&#8217;s flank!</p>
<p>Ralston watched them until they had loaded their
meat upon the pack-horses and started homeward.
One thing was certain: if Running Rabbit had
butchered the Bar C cattle, he had done so under a
white man&#8217;s supervision. In this instance, with an
Indian&#8217;s usual economy in the matter of meat, he
had left little but the horns and hoofs. The Bar
C cattle had been butchered with the white man&#8217;s
indifference to waste.</p>
<p>Any one of the bunk-house crowd, except
McArthur, Ralston believed to be quite capable of
stealing cattle for beef purposes. But if they had
been stealing systematically, as it would appear,
why had they killed MacDonald cattle to-day?
Ralston still regarded the affair of the fresh hide
as too suspicious a circumstance to be overlooked,
and he meant to learn which of the white grub-liners
had been absent. He reasoned that the
Indians had a wholesome fear of Colonel Tolman,
and that it was unlikely they would venture upon
his range for such a purpose without a white man&#8217;s
moral support.</p>
<p>Smith had been missing frequently of late and
for so long as two days at a time, but this could
not be regarded as peculiar, since the habits of all
the grub-liners were more or less erratic. They
disappeared and reappeared, with no explanation
of their absence.</p>
<p>In his present frame of mind, Ralston had no
desire to return immediately to the ranch. He
wanted to be alone; to harden his heart against
Dora; to prepare his mind for more shocks such
as he had had of late. It was not an easy task
he had set himself.</p>
<p>After a time he dismounted, and, throwing down
his bridle-reins, dropped to the ground to rest,
while his horse nibbled contentedly at the sparse
bunch-grass. As he lay in the sunshine, his hands
clasped behind his head, the stillness acted like a
sedative, and something of the tranquillity about
him crept into his soul.</p>
<p>Upon one thing he was determined, and that was,
come what might, to be a <i>man</i>&mdash;a gentleman. If
in his conceit and eagerness he had misunderstood
the softness of Dora&#8217;s eyes, her shy tremulousness,
as he now believed he had, he could take his medicine
like a man, and go when the time came, without
whimpering, without protest or reproach. He
wanted to go away feeling that he had her respect,
at least; go knowing that there was not a single
word or action of his upon which she could look
back with contempt. Yes, he wanted greatly her
respect. She inspired in him this desire.</p>
<p>Ralston felt very humble, very conscious of his
own shortcomings, as he lay there while the afternoon
waned; but, humble as he was, resigned as
he believed himself to be, he could not think of
Smith with anything but resentment and contempt.
It hurt his pride, his self-respect, to regard Smith
in the light of a rival&mdash;a successful rival.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Gad!&#8221; he cried aloud, and with a heat which
belied his self-abnegation. &#8220;If he were only a <i>decent</i>
white man! But to be let down and out by
the only woman I ever gave a whoop for in all my
life, for a fellow like that! Say, it&#8217;s tough!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralston&#8217;s newly acquired serenity, the depth of
which he had reason to doubt, was further disturbed
by a distant clatter of hoofs. He sat up
and watched the oncoming of the angriest-looking
Indian that ever quirted a cayuse over a reservation.
It was Bear Chief, whom he knew slightly.
Seeing Ralston&#8217;s saddled horse, the Indian pulled
up a little, which was as well, since the white man
was immediately in his path.</p>
<p>As the Indian came back, Ralston, who had
rolled over to let him pass, remarked dryly:</p>
<p>&#8220;The country is getting so crowded, it&#8217;s hardly
safe for a man to sit around like this. What&#8217;s the
excitement, Bear Chief?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Horse-thief steal Indian horses!&#8221; he cried,
pointing toward the Bad Lands.</p>
<p>Ralston was instantly alert.</p>
<p>&#8220;Him ridin&#8217; my race-pony&mdash;fastest pony on de
reservation. Got big bunch. Runnin&#8217; &#8217;em off!&#8221;</p>
<p>Fast moving specks that rose and fell among
the hills of the Bad Lands bore out the Indian&#8217;s
words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralston was slipping the bit back in his horse&#8217;s
mouth and tightening the cinch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yas, I see him. Long way off, but I see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yas, I know him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was it?&#8221; Ralston was in the saddle
now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little white man&mdash;what you call him &#8216;bug-hunter&#8217;&mdash;at
de MacDonald ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;McArthur!&#8221; Their horses were gathering
speed as they turned them toward the Bad Lands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yas. Little; hair on face&mdash;so; wear what
you call dem sawed-off pants.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the description, Ralston recognized
McArthur&#8217;s English riding-breeches, which had
added zest to life for the bunk-house crowd when
he had appeared in them. The deputy-sheriff was
bewildered. It seemed incredible, yet there, still in
sight, was the flying band of horses, and Bear
Chief&#8217;s positiveness seemed to leave no room for
doubt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, him one heap good thief,&#8221; panted Bear
Chief, in unwilling admiration, as their horses ran
side by side. &#8220;He work fast. No &#8217;fraid. Cut &#8217;em
out&mdash;head &#8217;em off&mdash;turn &#8217;em&mdash;ride through big
brush&mdash;jump de gulch&mdash;yell and swing de quirt,
and do him all &#8217;lone! Dat no easy work&mdash;cut out
horses all &#8217;lone. Him heap good horse-thief!&#8221;</p>
<p>What did it mean, anyhow? Ralston asked himself
the question again and again. Was it possible
that he had been deceived in McArthur? That,
after all, he was a criminal of an extraordinary
type? He found no answer to his questions, but
both he and Bear Chief soon realized that they
were exhausting their horses in a useless pursuit.
It was growing dark; the thief had too much start,
and, with the experience of an old hand, he drove the
horses over rocks, where they left no blabbing tracks
behind. Once well into the Bad Lands, he was
as effectually lost as if the earth had opened and
swallowed him.</p>
<p>So they turned their tired horses back, reaching
the ranch long after sundown. Ralston was still
unconvinced that it was not a case of mistaken
identity, and, hoping against hope, he asked some
one loafing about while he and Bear Chief unsaddled
if McArthur had returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been off prowlin&#8217; all day, and ain&#8217;t in
yet,&#8221; was the answer; and Bear Chief grunted at
this confirmation of his accusation.</p>
<p>The Indian woman was waiting in the doorway
when they came up the path.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see Susie?&#8221; There was uneasiness in her
voice.</p>
<p>It was an unheard-of thing for Susie not to return
from her rides and visits before dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not since morning,&#8221; Ralston replied. &#8220;Has
any one gone to look for her? Is Smith here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Smith no come home for supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There seems to have been a general exodus to-day,&#8221;
Ralston observed. &#8220;Are you feeling worried
about Susie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I no like. Yas, I feel worry for Susie.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the first evidence of maternal interest
that Ralston ever had seen the stoical woman show.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Ling will give me a bite to eat, I&#8217;ll saddle
another horse and ride down below. She may be
spending the night with some of her friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She no do that without tell me,&#8221; declared the
woman positively. &#8220;Susie no do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She brought the food from the kitchen herself,
and padded uneasily from window to window while
they ate.</p>
<p>What was in the wind, Ralston asked himself,
that Susie, McArthur, and Smith should disappear
in this fashion on the same day? It was a singular
coincidence. Like her mother, Ralston had no
notion that Susie was stopping the night at any
ranch or lodge below. He, too, shared the Indian
woman&#8217;s misgivings.</p>
<p>He had finished and was reaching for his hat
when footsteps were heard on the hard-beaten dooryard.
They were slow, lagging, unfamiliar to the
listeners, who looked at each other inquiringly.
Then the Indian woman threw open the door, and
Susie, like the ghost of herself, staggered from the
darkness outside into the light.</p>
<p>No ordinary fatigue could make her look as she
looked now. Every step showed complete and utter
exhaustion. Her dishevelled hair was hanging in
strands over her face, her eyes were dark-circled,
she was streaked with dust and grime, and her thin
shoulders drooped wearily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you been, Susie?&#8221; her mother asked
sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teacher said,&#8221; she made a pitiful attempt to
laugh, to speak lightly&mdash;&#8220;Teacher said ridin&#8217;
horseback would keep you from gettin&#8217; fat. I&mdash;I&#8217;ve
been reducin&#8217; my hips.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do dis no more!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry&mdash;I shan&#8217;t!&#8221; And as if her
mother&#8217;s reproach was the last straw, Susie covered
her face with the crook of her elbow and cried
hysterically.</p>
<p>Ralston was convinced that the day had held
something out of the ordinary for Susie. He knew
that it would take an extraordinary ride so completely
to exhaust a girl who was all but born in
the saddle. But it was evident from her reply that
she did not mean to tell where she had been or
what she had been doing.</p>
<p>Although Ralston soon retired, he was awake
long after his numerous room-mates were snoring
in their bunks. There was much to be done on
the morrow, yet he could not sleep. He was not
able to rid himself of the thought that there was
something peculiar in the absence of Smith just at
this time, nor could he entirely abandon the belief
that McArthur would yet come straggling in, with
an explanation of the whole affair. He could not
think of any that would be satisfactory, but an
underlying faith in the little scientist&#8217;s honesty
persisted.</p>
<p>Toward morning he slept, and day was breaking
when a step on the door-sill of the bunk-house
awakened him. He raised himself slightly on his
elbow and stared at McArthur, looming large in
the gray dawn, with a skull carried carefully in
both hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;m glad to find you awake!&#8221; He tiptoed
across the floor.</p>
<p>His clothing was wrinkled with the damp, night
air, and his face looked haggard in the cold light,
but the fire of enthusiasm burned undimmed behind
his spectacles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulate me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do&mdash;what for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear sir, if I can prove to the satisfaction
of scientific sceptics that this cranium is not
pathological, I shall have bounded in a single day&mdash;night&mdash;bounded
from comparative obscurity to
the pinnacle of fame! Undoubtedly&mdash;beyond
question&mdash;a race of giants existed in North
America&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; Ralston interrupted his husky
eloquence; &#8220;but where have you been all night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, where have I <i>not</i> been? Walking&mdash;walking
under the stars! Under the stimulus of success,
I have covered miles with no feeling of fatigue.
Have you ever experienced, my dear sir, the sensation
which comes from the realization of a life-dream?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; Ralston replied prosaically. &#8220;Where
was your horse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, my horse. Where <i>is</i> my horse? I
asked myself that question each time that I stopped
to remove one of the poisonous spines of the cactus
from my feet. Whether my horse lost me or I lost
my horse, I am unable to say. I left him grazing
in a gulch, and was not again able to locate the
gulch. I wandered all night&mdash;or until Fate guided
me into a barbed wire fence, where, as you will
observe, I tore my trousers. I followed the fence,
and here I am&mdash;I and my companion&#8221;&mdash;McArthur
patted the skull lovingly&mdash;&#8220;this giant&mdash;the slayer
of mastodons&mdash;whose history lies concealed in &#8216;the
dark backward and abysm of time&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>As he looked into Ralston&#8217;s non-committal eyes
with his own burning orbs, he realized that great
joy, like great sorrow, is something which cannot
well be shared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; he said with hurt dignity; &#8220;I
have again forgotten that you have no interest
in such things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mistaken. I wanted to hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>After McArthur had retired to his pneumatic
mattress, Ralston lay wide-eyed, more mystified than
before. Had Bear Chief&#8217;s eyes deceived him, or
was McArthur the cleverest of rogues?</p>
<p>Breakfast was done when Ralston said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be good enough to step into the
bunk-house, Mr. McArthur?&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in his voice chilled the sensitive man.
Ralston, whom he greatly admired, always had been
most friendly. He followed him now in wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are sure this is the man, Bear Chief?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian had stepped forward at their entrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yas, I know him,&#8221; he reiterated.</p>
<p>McArthur looked from one to the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bear Chief accuses you of stealing his horses,
Mr. McArthur,&#8221; explained Ralston bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You slick little horse-thief, but I see you good.
Where you cache my race-pony?&#8221; The Indian&#8217;s
demand was a threat.</p>
<p>For reply, McArthur walked over and sat down
on the edge of a bunk, as if his legs of a sudden
were too weak to support him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bear Chief swears he saw you, McArthur.&#8221;
Ralston&#8217;s tone was not unfriendly now, for something
within him pleaded the bug-hunter&#8217;s cause
with irritating persistence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me a horse-thief? Running off race-ponies?&#8221;
McArthur found himself able to exclaim at last:
&#8220;But I had no horse of my own!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any credentials&mdash;anything at all by
which we can identify you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not with me; but certainly I can furnish them.
The name of McArthur is not unknown in Connecticut,&#8221;
he answered with a tinge of pride.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are your riding-breeches? Bear Chief
says you were wearing them yesterday. Can you
produce them now?&#8221;</p>
<p>McArthur, with hauteur, walked to the nails
where his wardrobe hung and fumbled among the
clothing.</p>
<p>They were gone!</p>
<p>His jaw dropped, and a slight pallor overspread
his face.</p>
<p>Susie, who had been listening from the doorway,
flung a flour-sack at his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Search my trunk, pardner,&#8221; she said with her
old-time impish grin.</p>
<p>McArthur mechanically did as she bade him, and
his riding-breeches dropped from the sack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll &#8217;scuse me for makin&#8217; so free with
your clothes, like,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but I just naturally
had to have them yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>A light broke in upon Ralston.</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep, I did it, me&mdash;Susie.&#8221; Her tone and
manner were a ludicrous imitation of Smith&#8217;s. She
added: &#8220;I saw you all pikin&#8217; in here, so I tagged.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why&#8221;&mdash;Ralston stared at her in incredulity&mdash;&#8220;why
should <i>you</i> steal horses?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this way,&#8221; Susie explained, in a loud, confidential
whisper: &#8220;I&#8217;ve been playin&#8217; a little game
of my own. When the right time came, I meant
to let Mr. Ralston in on it, but when Bear Chief
saw me, I knew I&#8217;d have to tell, to keep my pardner
here from gettin&#8217; the blame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the beard,&#8221;&mdash;Ralston still looked sceptical.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks! That&#8217;s easy. I saw Bear Chief before
he saw me, and I just took the black silk
hankerchief from my neck and tied it hold-up
fashion around the lower part of my face. Bear
Chief was excited when he saw his running horse
travelling out of the country at the gait we was
goin&#8217; then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see yet, Susie?&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned upon Ralston in good-natured contempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, but you&#8217;re slow! Don&#8217;t you understand?
Smith&#8217;s my pal; we&#8217;re workin&#8217; together.
He cooked this up&mdash;him takin&#8217; the safe and easy
end of it himself. He sprung it on me that day
I had a sull on. Don&#8217;t you see his game? He
thinks if he can get me mixed up in something
crooked, he can manage me. He&#8217;s noticed, maybe,
that I&#8217;m not halter-broke. So I pretended to fall
right in with his plans, once I had promised, meanin&#8217;
all the time to turn state&#8217;s evidence, or whatever
you call it, and send him over the road. I wanted
to show Mother and everybody else what kind of
a man he is. I don&#8217;t want no step-papa named
Smith.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three men stared in amazement at the intrepid
little creature with her canny Scotch eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you mean to say,&#8221; Ralston asked, &#8220;that
you&#8217;ve held your tongue and played your part
so well that Smith has no suspicions?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hatin&#8217; makes you smart,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;and
I hate Smith so hard I can&#8217;t sleep nights. No,
I don&#8217;t think he is suspicious; because I&#8217;m to
pack grub to him this morning, and if he was
afraid of me, he&#8217;d never let me know where he
was camped. He&#8217;s holdin&#8217; the horses over there in
a blind canyon, and when I go over I&#8217;m to help
him blotch the brands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to get the drop on him when he&#8217;s
using the branding-iron.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you want to see that he shoves up his
hands and keeps them there,&#8221; suggested Susie
further, &#8220;for he&#8217;ll take big chances rather than
have the Schoolmarm see him ridin&#8217; to the Agency
with his wrists tied to the saddle-horn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221; Ralston knew even better than Susie
that Smith would fight like a rat in a corner to
avoid this possibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; and Susie gave an explosive sigh, &#8220;but
it&#8217;s an awful relief not to have that secret to
pack around any longer, and to feel that I&#8217;ve got
somebody to back me up.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lump rose in Ralston&#8217;s throat, and, taking her
brown little paws in both of his, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;To the limit, Susie&mdash;to the end of the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And my pardner&#8217;s in on it, too, if he wants
to be,&#8221; she declared loyally, slipping her arm
through McArthur&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure,&#8221; Ralston seconded cordially. &#8220;It
will be an adventure for your diary.&#8221; He added,
laying his hand upon McArthur&#8217;s shoulder: &#8220;I&#8217;m
more than sorry about the mistake this morning,
old man. Will you forgive Bear Chief and me?&#8221;</p>
<p>In all McArthur&#8217;s studious, lonely life, no person
ever had put his hand upon his shoulder and called
him &#8220;old man.&#8221; The quick tears filled his eyes,
and a glow, tingling in its warmth, rushed over
him. The simple, manly act made him Ralston&#8217;s
slave for life, but he answered in his quiet voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;The mistake was natural, my dear sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Smith will be gettin&#8217; restless,&#8221; Susie suggested,
&#8220;for his breakfast must have been pretty slim.
We&#8217;d better be startin&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;ll take straight across the hills in a
bee-line, and the rest of you keep me in sight, but
follow the draws. When I drop into the canyon,
you cache yourselves until I come up and swing
my hat. I&#8217;ll do my best to separate Smith from
his gun, but if I can&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll throw you the sign
to jump him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall arm myself with a pistol, and, if the
occasion demands, I shall not hesitate to use it,&#8221;
said McArthur, closing his lips with great firmness.</p>
<p>Bear Chief was given a rifle, and then there was
a scurrying about for cartridges. When they were
saddled, each rode in a different direction, to meet
again when out of sight of the ranch. With varied
emotions, they soon were following Susie&#8217;s lead, and
it was no easy task to keep the flying figure in
sight.</p>
<p>McArthur, panting, perspiring, choking his
saddle-horn to death, wondered if any person of his
acquaintance ever had participated in such a reckless
ride. The instructor in Dead Languages, it
is true, frequently had thrilled his colleagues with
his recital of a night spent in a sapling, owing to
the proximity of a she-bear, and McArthur always
had mildly envied him the adventure, but now, he
felt, if he lived to tell the tale, he had no further
cause for envy.</p>
<p>Bear Chief&#8217;s eyes were gleaming with the fires
of other days, while the faded overalls and flannel
shirt of civilization seemed to take on a look of
savagery.</p>
<p>Only Ralston&#8217;s eyes were sombre. He had no
thought of weakening, but he had no feeling of
elation; though, for the sake of his own self-respect,
he was glad to know that his suspicions
of Smith were not inspired by jealousy or malice.
Now that the opportunity for which he had hoped
and waited had come, his strongest feeling was one
of sorrow for Dora. With the tenderness of real
love, he shrank from hurting her, from mortifying
her by the exposé of Smith.</p>
<p>In no other way were the natures of the two
men more strongly contrasted than in this. When
Smith flamed with jealousy he wanted to hurt Dora
and Ralston alike, and when he had the advantage
he shoved the hot iron home. Ralston could be
just, generous even, and, though he believed she
had unreservedly given her preference to Smith, he
still yearned to shield her, to spare her pain and
humiliation.</p>
<p>Susie finally disappeared, and when she did not
come in sight again they knew she had reached
the rendezvous. Dismounting, they tied their
horses in a deep draw, and crawled to the top,
where they could watch for her signal.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll give him plenty of time,&#8221; said Ralston.</p>
<p>He had barely finished speaking when they saw
Susie at the top of the canyon wall waving her
hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s gone wrong,&#8221; said Ralston
quickly.</p>
<p>With rifles ready for action, the three of them
ran toward Susie.</p>
<p>Ralston and Bear Chief reached her together.
Without a word she pointed into the empty canyon,
where a dying camp-fire told the story. Smith had
been gone for hours.</p>

<h3>WHERE A MAN GETS A THIRST</h3>
</div>

<p>While the four stood staring blankly at the
trampled earth and the thin thread of smoke rising
from a smouldering stick on a bed of ashes, Smith,
miles away, was watching the skyline in the
direction from which he had come, and gulping
coffee from a tin can. He had slept&mdash;the print
of his body was still in the sand&mdash;but his sleep had
been broken and brief. He had ridden fast and all
night long, but he was not yet far enough away
to feel secure. There was always a danger, too,
that the horses would break for their home range,
although he kept the mare who led the band on
the picket rope when they were not travelling. His
own horse, always saddled, was picketed close.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never make a turn like this alone again,&#8221;
he muttered discontentedly. &#8220;It&#8217;s too much like
work to suit me, and I ain&#8217;t in shape to make a hard
ride. I&#8217;ve got soft layin&#8217; around the ranch.&#8221; He
stretched his stiff muscles and made a wry face.
Then he smiled. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to see that brat&#8217;s face
when she comes with my grub this mornin&#8217;.&#8221; He
looked off again to the skyline.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ketched her eyein&#8217; me once or twice in a
way that didn&#8217;t look good to me; and I had that
notorious strong feelin&#8217; take holt of me that she
wasn&#8217;t on the square. I&#8217;d better be sure nor sorry;&mdash;that&#8217;s
no josh. I takes no chances, me&mdash;Smith;
I tips my hand to no petticoat.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted with relief that the wind was rising.
He was glad, for it would obliterate every print
and make tracking impossible. He had kept to the
rocks, as the unshod and now foot-sore horses bore
evidence, but, even so, there was always a chance
of tell-tale prints.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can take it easy after I get to water,&#8221; he
told himself. &#8220;This water business is ser&#8217;ous&#8221;&mdash;he
looked uneasily at the stretch of desolation ahead
of him&mdash;&#8220;but unless the Injuns lied, they&#8217;s <i>some</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the boys are to home,&#8221; he went on,
&#8220;for if they are it won&#8217;t take us long to work
these brands over. When they take &#8217;em off my
hands and I gets my wad, I&#8217;ll soak it away, me&mdash;Smith.
I&#8217;ll hand it in at the bank, and I&#8217;ll say to
the dude at the winder, &#8217;Feller,&#8217; I&#8217;ll say, &#8216;me
and a little Schoolmarm are goin&#8217; to housekeepin&#8217;
after while, so just hang on to that till I calls.&#8217;&#8221;
Smith grinned appreciatively at the picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;His eyes will stick out till you could snare &#8217;em
with a log-chain, for I ain&#8217;t known as a marryin&#8217;
man.&#8221; His face sobered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get to
work and get a wad&mdash;she shot that into me
straight; and she&#8217;s right. I couldn&#8217;t ask no woman
like her to hang out her own wash in front of a
two-roomed shack. I got to get the <i>dinero</i>, and
between man and man, Smith, like you and me, I&#8217;m
nowise particular how I gets it, so long as she
don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ll take any old chance, me&mdash;Smith.
And dead men&#8217;s eyes hasn&#8217;t got the habit of follerin&#8217;
me around in the dark, like some I&#8217;ve knowed.
She&#8217;d think I was a horrible feller if&mdash;but shucks!
What&#8217;s done&#8217;s done.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lifted his arms and stretched them toward
the skyline, and his voice vibrated:</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you, girl! I love you, and I couldn&#8217;t
hurt you no more nor a baby!&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he coiled the picket-ropes and started the
horses moving, he got down on his knees and took
a mouthful of water from a lukewarm pool. He
spat it upon the ground in disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s worse nor pizen,&#8221; he declared with a
grimace. &#8220;You bet I&#8217;ve got to strike water to-day
somehow. The horses won&#8217;t hardly touch this,
and they&#8217;re all ga&#8217;nted up for the want of it. There
ought to be water over there in some of them
gulches, seems-like&#8221;&mdash;he looked anxiously at the
expanse stretching interminably to the northeast&mdash;&#8220;and
I&#8217;ll have to haze &#8217;em along until we hit it.&#8221;</p>
<p>His tired horse seemed to sag beneath his weight
as he landed heavily in the saddle; and the band
of foot-sore horses, the hair of their necks and
legs stiff with sweat and dust, bore little resemblance
to the spirited animals that Susie had driven
from the reservation. It was now no effort to
keep up with them, and Smith herded them in front
of him like a flock of sheep. He wondered what
another day, perhaps two days more, of constant
travel would do, if fifty miles or so had used them
up. There was not now the fear of capture to
urge him forward, but the need of reaching water
was an equally great incentive to haste.</p>
<p>Smith travelled until late in the afternoon without
an audible complaint at the intense discomforts
of the day. He found no water, and he ate only
a handful of sugar as he rode. He journeyed constantly
toward the northeast, in which direction,
he thought, must be the ranch which was his destination.
At each intervening gulch a hope arose
that it might contain water, but always he was
disappointed. Between the alkali dust and the
heat of the midday sun, which was unusually
hot for the time of year, his lips were cracked and
his throat dry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t this hell!&#8221; he finally muttered fretfully.
&#8220;And no more jump in this horse nor a cow. I
can do without grub, but water! Oh, Lord! I
could lap up a gallon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The slight motion of his lips started them bleeding.
He wiped the blood away on the back of
his hand and continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a reg&#8217;lar stretch of Bad Lands. If
them blamed Injuns hadn&#8217;t lied, I could have packed
water easy enough. They don&#8217;t seem to be no
end to it, and I must have come forty mile. You&#8217;re
in for it, Smith. It&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be worse before
it&#8217;s better. If I could only lay in a crick&mdash;roll in
it&mdash;douse my face in it&mdash;soak my clothes in it!
God! I&#8217;m dry!&#8221;</p>
<p>He spurred his horse, but there was no response
from it. It was dead on its feet, between the
hard travel of the previous day and night and
another day without water. He cursed the horses
ahead as they lagged and necessitated extra steps.</p>
<p>He rode for awhile longer, until he realized that
at the snail&#8217;s pace they were moving he was making
little headway. A rest would pay better in the
long run, although there was some two hours of
daylight left.</p>
<p>The dull-eyed horses stood with drooping heads,
too thirsty and too tired to hunt for the straggling
spears of grass and salt sage which grew sparsely
in the alkali soil.</p>
<p>After Smith had unsaddled, he opened the grain-sack
which contained his provisions. Spreading
them out, he stood and eyed them with contempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I calls myself a prairie man,&#8221; he said
aloud, in self-disgust. &#8220;Swine-buzzom&mdash;when I&#8217;m
perishin&#8217; of thirst! If only I&#8217;d put in a couple
of air-tights. Pears is better nor anything; they
ain&#8217;t so blamed sweet, they&#8217;re kind of cool, and they
has juice you can drink. And tomaters&mdash;if only
I had tomaters! This here dude-food, this strawberry
jam, is goin&#8217; to make me thirstier than ever.
No water to mix the flour with, nothing to cook
in but salt grease. Smith, you&#8217;re up against it,
you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>He built a little sage-brush fire, over which he
cooked his bacon, and with it he ate a dry biscuit,
but his thirst was so great that it overshadowed
his hunger. Chewing grains of coffee stimulated
him somewhat, but the bacon and glucose jam
increased his thirst tenfold, if such a thing
were possible. His thoughts of Dora, and his
dreams of the future, which had helped him through
the afternoon, were no longer potent. He could
now think only of his thirst&mdash;of his overpowering
desire for water. It filled his whole mental horizon.
Water! Water! Water! Was there anything in
the world to be compared with it!</p>
<p>His face was deep-lined with distress as he sat
by the camp-fire, trying in vain to moisten his
lips with his dry tongue. One picture after another
arose before him: streams of crystal water which
he had forded; icy mountain springs at which he
had knelt and drank; deep wells from which he
had thrown whole bucketfuls away after he had
quenched what he then called thirst. Thirst! He
never had known thirst. What he had called thirst
was laughable in comparison with this awful longing,
this madness, this desire beside which all else
paled.</p>
<p>In any other than an alkali country, the lack
of water for the same length of time would have
meant little more than discomfort, but the parching,
drying effect of the deadly white dust entailed
untold suffering upon the traveller caught unprepared
as was Smith.</p>
<p>He rolled and smoked innumerable cigarettes,
rising at intervals to pace restlessly to and fro.
His lips and tongue were so parched that both
taste and feeling seemed deadened. Had he not
seen the smoke, it is doubtful if he could have
been sure he was smoking.</p>
<p>He wandered away from the fire after a time,
walking aimlessly, having no objective point. He
desired only to be moving. Something like a half-mile
from his camp he came into a shallow cut
which appeared to have been made during bygone
rainy seasons, but which now bore no evidence of
having carried water for many years. He followed
it mechanically, stumbling awkwardly in his high-heeled
cowboy boots over the rocks which had
washed into its bed from the alkali-coated sides.
Suddenly he cried aloud, with a shrill, penetrating
cry that was peculiar to him when surprised or
startled. He had inadvertently kicked up a rock
which showed moisture beneath it!</p>
<p>He began to run, with his mouth open, his
bloodshot eyes wide and staring. There was a
bare chance that it might come from one of those
desert springs which appear and disappear at
irregular intervals in the sand. As he ran, he saw
hoof-tracks in what had once been mud, and his
heart beat higher with hope. He had a thought
in his half-crazed brain that the water might
disappear before he could reach it, and he ran
like one frenzied with fear. The world was swimming
around him, his heart was pounding in his
breast, yet still he stumbled on at top speed.</p>

IT MEANT DEATH&mdash;BUT IT WAS WET!&mdash;IT WAS WATER!<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The cut grew deeper, and indications of moisture
increased. He saw a growth of large sage-brush,
then a clump or two of rank, saw-edged
grass. These things meant water! He turned a
bend and there, beneath a high bank, was a pool
crusted to the edge with alkali!</p>
<p>Smith knew that it was strongly alkali; that
it meant certain illness&mdash;enough of it, death.
But it was wet!&mdash;it was water!&mdash;and he must
drink. He fell, rather than knelt, in it. When
taste came back he realized that it was flat and
lukewarm, but he continued to gulp it down. At
any other time it would have nauseated him, but
now he drank to his capacity. When he could
drink no more, he sat up&mdash;realizing what he had
done. He had swallowed liquid poison&mdash;nothing
less. The result was inevitable. He was going
to be ill&mdash;excruciatingly, terribly ill, alone in the
Bad Lands! This was as certain as was the fact
that night had come.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so dry,&#8221; he whimpered, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help
it! I was so dry!&#8221; He scrambled to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gotta get back to camp. This water&#8217;s goin&#8217;
to raise thunder when it begins to get in its work.
I gotta get back to my blankets and lay down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he reached the heap of ashes which he
called camp, the first symptoms of his coming
agony began to show themselves. He felt slightly
nauseated; then a quick, griping pain which was
a forerunner of others which were to make him
sweat blood.</p>
<p>Many of these springs and stagnant pools carry
arsenic in large quantities, and of such was the
water of which Smith had drunk. In his exhaustion,
the poison and accompanying impurities took
hold of him with a fierceness which it might not
have done had he been in perfect physical condition;
but his stomach, already disordered from
irregular and improper food, absorbed the poison
with avidity, and the result was an agony indescribable.</p>
<p>As he writhed on his saddle-blankets under the
stars, he groaned and cursed that unknown God
above him. His face and hands were covered with
a cold sweat; his forehead and finger-tips were
icy. The night air was chill, but he was burning
with an inward fever, and his thirst now was
akin to madness. With all his strength of will,
he fought against his desire to return to the pool.</p>
<p>Smith did not expect to die. He felt that if
he could keep his senses and not crawl back to
drink again, he would pull through somehow. The
living hell he now endured would pass.</p>
<p>He wallowed and threshed about like a suffering
animal, beating the earth with his clenched fists,
during the paroxysms of cutting, wrenching pain.
His suffering was supreme. All else in the world
shrank into insignificance beside it. No thoughts
of Dora fortified him; no mother&#8217;s face came to
comfort him; nor that of any human being he
had ever known. He was just Smith&mdash;self-centred&mdash;alone;
just Smith, fighting and suffering and
struggling for his life. His anguish found expression
in the single sentence:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sick! I&#8217;m sick! Oh, God! I&#8217;m sick!&#8221;
He repeated it in every key with every inflection,
and his moans lost themselves in the silence of the
desert.</p>
<p>Yet underneath it all, when his agony was at
its height, he still believed in himself. In a kind
of subconscious arrogance, he believed that he was
stronger than Fate, more powerful than Death.
He would not die; he would live because he wanted
to live. Death was not for him&mdash;Smith. For
others, but not for him.</p>
<p>At last the paroxysms became less frequent and
lost their violence. When they ceased altogether,
he lay limp and half-conscious. He was content
to remain motionless until the flies and insects of
the sand roused him to the fact that another day
had come.</p>
<p>He was incredibly weak, and it took all his remaining
strength to throw his forty-pound cow-saddle
upon his horse&#8217;s back. His knees shook
under him, and he had to rest before he could lift
his foot to the stirrup and pull himself into the
seat.</p>
<p>Before he rode away he turned and looked at
the hollow in the sand where his blankets had
been.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a close squeak, Smith,&#8221; was all he
said.</p>
<p>He had no desire for breakfast; in fact, he
could not have eaten, for his tongue was swollen,
and his throat felt too dry to swallow. His skin
was the color of his saddle-leather, and his inflamed
eye-balls had the redness of live coals. Smith was
far from handsome that morning.</p>
<p>His own recent sufferings had in nowise made
him more merciful: he spurred his stiff and lifeless
horse without pity, but he spurred uselessly.
It stumbled under him as he drove the spiritless
band toward the hopeless waste ahead of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless I&#8217;m turned around, we ought to get
out of this to-day,&#8221; he thought. The effort of
speaking aloud was too great to be made. &#8220;Unless
I&#8217;m lost, or fall off my horse, we ought to
make it sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Distance had meant nothing to him during the
first evening and night of his ride. He had fixed
his eye upon the furthermost object within his
range of vision and ridden for it&mdash;buoyant, confident,
as his horse&#8217;s flying feet ate up the intervening
miles. Now he shrank from looking ahead.
He dreaded to lift his eyes to the interminable
desolation stretching before him. The minutes
seemed hours long; time was protracted as though
he had been eating hasheesh. He felt as if he
had ridden for a week, before his horse&#8217;s shadow
told him that noon had come. The jar of his
horse hurt him, and it all seemed unreal at times,
like a torturing nightmare from which he must soon
awake. He rode long distances with closed eyes
as the day wore on. The world, red and wavering,
swung around him, and he gripped his saddle-horn
hard. The only real thing, the agony of
which was too great to be mistaken for anything
else, was his thirst. This was superlatively intense.
There were moments when he had a desire
to slide easily from his horse into the sand and
lie still&mdash;just to be rid for a time of that jar that
hurt him so. He viewed the distance to the ground
contemplatively. It was not great. He would
merely crumple up like a drunken person and go
to sleep.</p>
<p>But these moments soon passed: the instinct of
self-preservation was quick to assert itself. Each
time, he took a fresh grip on the slack reins and
kept his horse plodding onward, ever onward,
through the heavy sand and blistering alkali dust,
and always to the northeast, where somewhere there
was relief which somehow he must reach.</p>
<p>Mile after mile crept under his horse&#8217;s lagging
feet. The midday sun beat down upon him, drying
the very blood in his veins, scorching him, shrivelling
him, and yet there seemed no end to the waterless
gulches, to the sand, the cactuses, the stunted sage-brush.
His horse was stumbling oftener, but he
felt no pity&mdash;only irritation that it had not more
stamina. A sort of numbness, the lethargy of
great weakness, was creeping over him; his heart
was sagging with a dull despair. He believed that
he must be lost, yet he was past cursing or complaining
aloud. Only an occasional gasp or a
fretful, inarticulate sound came when his horse
stumbled badly.</p>
<p>He thought he saw a barbed wire fence. A
barbed wire fence meant civilization! He swung
his horse and rode toward it. The dark spots
he had thought were posts were only sage-brush.
The smarting of his eye-balls and eyelids aroused
him to an astonishing fact: he was crying in his
weakness, crying of disappointment like a child!
But he was astonished most that he had tears to
shed&mdash;that they had not dried up like his blood.</p>
<p>Tears! He remembered his last tears, and they
kept on sliding down his cheek now as he recalled
the occasion. His father had given him a colt
back there where they slept between sheets. He
had broken it himself, and taught it tricks. It
whinnied to him when he passed the stable. The
other boys envied him his colt, and he meant to
show it at the fair. He came home one day and
the colt was gone. His father handed him a silver
dollar. He had thrown the money at his father
and struck him in the face, and while the tears
streamed from his eyes he had cursed his father
with the oaths with which his father had so frequently
cursed him; and he had kept on cursing
until he was beaten into unconsciousness. There
had been no love between them, ever, but he had
not expected that. Since then there had been no
time or inclination for tears, for it was then he
had &#8220;quit the flat.&#8221; The rage of his boyhood
came back to Smith as he thought of it now. He
swore, though it hurt him to speak.</p>
<p>His eyes were still smarting when he raised them
to see a horseman on a distant ridge. The sight
roused him like a stimulant. Was he friend or
foe? He reined his horse, and, drawing his rifle
from its scabbard, waited; for the stranger had
seen him and was riding toward him down the
ridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he ain&#8217;t my kind, I&#8217;ll have to stop him,&#8221;
Smith muttered.</p>
<p>The strength of excitement came to him, and
once more he sat erect in the saddle, fingering the
trigger as the horseman came steadily on.</p>
<p>&#8220;He rides like a Texican,&#8221; Smith thought.
There was something familiar in the stranger&#8217;s
outlines, the way he threw his weight in one stirrup,
but Smith was taking no chances. He put
out a hand in warning, and the other man stopped.</p>
<p>The swarthy face of the stranger wore a comprehending
grin. No honest man drove horses
across the Bad Lands. He threw the Indian sign
of friendship to Smith, and they each advanced.</p>
<p>&#8220;How far to water, Clayt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, dog-gone me! Smith!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How far to water?&#8221; Smith yelled the words
in hoarse ferocity.</p>
<p>The stranger glanced at the barebacked horses,
and then at the shimmering heat waves of the
desert.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just around the ridge,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;My
God, man, didn&#8217;t you pack water?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Smith was already out of hearing.</p>

<h3>TINHORN FRANK SMELLS MONEY</h3>
</div>

<p>Smith did not care for money in itself; that
is, he did not care for it enough to work for it,
or to hoard it when he had it. Yet perhaps even
more than most persons he loved the feel of it in
his fingers, the sensation of having it in his pocket.
Smith was vain, in his way, and money satisfied
his vanity. It gave him prestige, power, the attention
he craved. He could call any flashy talker&#8217;s
bluff when his pockets were full of money. It
imparted self-assurance. He could the better indulge
his propensity for resenting slights, either
real or fancied. Money would buy him out of
trouble. Yes, Smith liked the feel of money. He
took a roll of banknotes from the belt pocket of
his leather chaps and counted them for the third
time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll buy a few drinks, flash this wad on them
pinheads in town, and then I&#8217;ll soak it away.&#8221;
He returned the roll to his pocket with an expression
of satisfaction upon his face.</p>
<p>He had done well with the horses. The &#8220;boys&#8221;
had paid him a third more than he had expected;
they had done so, he knew, as an incentive to
further transactions. And Smith had outlined a
plan to them which had made their eyes sparkle.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s risky, but if you can do it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; they had
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I can do it, and I&#8217;ll start as soon as
it&#8217;s safe after I get back to the ranch. I gotta
get to work and make a stake&mdash;<i>me</i>,&#8221; he had declared.</p>
<p>They had looked at him quizzically.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is, I&#8217;m tired of livin&#8217; under my hat.
I aims to settle down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And reform?&#8221; They had laughed uproariously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to notice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith sincerely believed that nothing stood between
him and Dora but his lack of money. Once
she saw it, the actual money, when he could go
to her and throw it in her lap, a hatful, and say,
&#8220;Come on, girl&#8221;&mdash;well, women were like that, he
told himself.</p>
<p>Ahead of Smith, on the dusty flat, was the
little cow-town, looking, in the distance, like a
scattered herd of dingy sheep. He was glad his
ride was ended for the day. He was thirsty, hot,
and a bit tired.</p>
<p>Tinhorn Frank, resting the small of his back
against a monument of elk and buffalo horns in
front of his log saloon, was the first to spy Smith
ambling leisurely into town.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Smithy!&#8221; he exclaimed to the man
who loafed beside him, &#8220;and he&#8217;s got a roll!&#8221;</p>
<p>His fellow lounger looked at him curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tinhorn, I b&#8217;lieve you kin <i>smell</i> money; and
I swear they&#8217;s kind of a scum comes over your
eyes when you see it. How do you know he&#8217;s
carryin&#8217; a roll?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tinhorn Frank laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know Smithy as well as if I had made him.
I kin tell by the way he rides. I always could.
When he&#8217;s broke he&#8217;s slouchy-like. He don&#8217;t take
no pride in coilin&#8217; his rope, and he jams his hat
over his eyes&mdash;tough. Look at him now&mdash;settin&#8217;
square in the saddle, his rope coiled like a top
Californy cowboy on a Fourth of July. That&#8217;s
how I know. Hello, Smithy! Fall off and
arrigate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; Smith answered deliberately.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s she comin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Slow.&#8221; He swung his leg over the cantle of
the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll you have?&#8221; Tinhorn slapped Smith&#8217;s
back so hard that the dust rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get me out somethin&#8217; stimulating, somethin&#8217;
fur-reachin&#8217;, somethin&#8217; that you can tell where it
stops. I want a drink that feels like a yard of
barb-wire goin&#8217; down.&#8221; Smith was tying his horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s somethin&#8217; special,&#8221; said Tinhorn, when
Smith went inside. &#8220;I keeps it for my friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith swallowed nearly a tumblerful.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I drinks, I drinks, and I likes somethin&#8217;
I can notice.&#8221; He wiped the tears out of his eyes
with the back of his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guarantee you kin notice that in about five
minutes. It&#8217;s a never failing remedy for man and
beast&mdash;not meaning to claim that its horse liniment
at all. Put it back, Smithy; your money
ain&#8217;t good here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tinhorn Frank&#8217;s dark eyes gleamed with an
avaricious light at sight of the roll of yellow banknotes
which Smith flung carelessly upon the bar,
but he had earned his living by his wits too long
to betray eagerness. He masked the adamantine
hardness of his grasping nature beneath an air of
generous and bluff good-fellowship.</p>
<p>He was a dark man, with a skin of oily sallowness;
thickset, with something of the slow ungainliness
of a toad. His head was set low between
stooped shoulders, and his crafty eyes had in them
a look of scheming, scheming always for his own
interests. Smith knew his record as well as he
knew his own: a dance-hall hanger-on in his youth,
despised of men; a blackmailer; the keeper of a
notorious road-house; a petty grafter in a small
political office in the little cow-town. Smith understood
perfectly the source of his present interest,
yet it flattered him almost as much as if it had
been sincere, it pleased him as if he had been the
object of a gentleman&#8217;s attentions. When he had
money, Smith demanded satellites, sycophants who
would laugh boisterously at his jokes, praise him
in broad compliments, and follow him like a paid
retinue from saloon to saloon. This was enjoying
life! And upon this weakness, the least clever, the
most insignificant and unimportant person could
play if he understood Smith.</p>
<p>The word had gone down the line that Smith
was in town with money. They rallied around him
with loud protestations of joy at the sight of him.
Smith held the centre of the stage, he was the
conspicuous figure, the magnet which drew them
all. He gloried in it, revelled in his popularity;
and the &#8220;special brand&#8221; was beginning to sizzle
in his veins.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m feelin&#8217; lucky to-day, me&mdash;Smith!&#8221; he cried
exultantly. &#8220;I has a notorious idea that I can
buck the wheel and win!&#8221;</p>
<p>He had not meant to gamble&mdash;he had told himself
that he would not; but his admiring friends
urged him on, his blood was running fast and hot,
his heart beat high with confidence and hope. Big
prospects loomed ahead of him; success looked
easy. He flung his money recklessly upon the red
and black, and with throbbing pulses watched the
wheel go round.</p>
<p>Again and again he won. It seemed as if he
could not lose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m feelin&#8217; lucky!&#8221;</p>
<p>When he finally stopped, his winnings were the
envy of many eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Set &#8217;em up, Tinhorn! Everybody drink!
Bring in the horses!&#8221;</p>
<p>Bedlam reigned. It was &#8220;Smithy this&#8221; and
&#8220;Smithy that,&#8221; and it was all as the breath of
life to Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tinhorn&#8221;&mdash;he leaned heavily on the bar&mdash;&#8220;when
I feels lucky like this, I makes it a rule
to crowd my luck. Are you game for stud?&#8221;</p>
<p>The film which the lounger had mentioned
seemed to cover Tinhorn&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m locoed to set agin such luck as yours, but
I like to be sociable, and you don&#8217;t come often.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I likes a swift game,&#8221; said Smith, as he pulled
a chair from the pine table. &#8220;Draw is good
enough for kids and dudes, but stud&#8217;s the only
play for men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;ve talked!&#8221; declared the admiring
throng.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep &#8217;em movin&#8217;, Tinhorn! Deal &#8217;em out fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Smithy, you&#8217;re a cyclone!&#8221;</p>
<p>A hundred of Smith&#8217;s money went for chips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dough is jest like mud to some fellers,&#8221; said
a voice enviously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I likes a game where you make or break on
a hand. I&#8217;ve lost thousands while you could spit,
me&mdash;Smith!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like a chinook in winter just to see you
in town agin, Smithy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;hole&#8221; card was not promising&mdash;it was
only a six-spot; but, backing his luck, Smith bet
high on it. Tinhorn came back at him strong.
He wanted Smith&#8217;s money, and he wanted it quick.</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s next card was a jack, and he bet three
times its value. When Tinhorn dealt him another
jack he bought more chips and backed his pair,
for Tinhorn, as yet, had none in sight. The next
turn showed up a queen for Tinhorn and a three-spot
for Smith. And they bet and raised, and
raised again. On the last turn Smith drew another
three and Tinhorn another queen. With two pairs
in sight, Smith had him beaten. When Smith bet,
Tinhorn raised him. Was Tinhorn bluffing or did
he have another queen in the &#8220;hole&#8221;? Smith believed
he was bluffing, but there was an equal chance
that he was not. While he hesitated, the other
watched him like a hungry mountain lion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you gettin&#8217; cold feet, Smithy?&#8221; There
was the suspicion of a sneer in the satellite&#8217;s voice.
&#8220;Did you say you liked to make or break on a
hand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you liked a swift game,&#8221; gibed Tinhorn.</p>
<p>The taunt settled it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can play as swift as most&mdash;and then, some.&#8221;
He shoved a pile of chips into the centre of the
table with both hands. &#8220;Come again!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tinhorn did come again; and again, and again,
and again. He bet with the confidence of knowledge&mdash;with
a confidence that put the fear in Smith&#8217;s
heart. But he could not, and he would not, quit
now. His jaw was set as he pulled off banknote
after banknote in the tense silence which had fallen.</p>
<p>When the last of them fluttered to the table he
asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;What you got?&#8221;</p>
<p>For answer, Tinhorn turned over a third queen.
Encircling the pile of money and chips with his
arm, he swept them toward him.</p>
<p>Smith rose and kicked the chair out of his way.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the end of my rope,&#8221; he said, with a
hard laugh. &#8220;I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a drink,&#8221; urged Tinhorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to-day,&#8221; he answered shortly.</p>
<p>The crowd parted to let him pass. Untying his
horse, he sprang into the saddle, and not much
more than an hour from the time he had arrived
he rode down the main street, past the bank where
he was to leave his roll, flat broke.</p>
<p>At the end of the street he turned in his saddle
and looked behind him. His satellites stood in
the bar-room door, loungers loafed on the curbstone,
a woman or two drifted into the General
Merchandise Store. The Postmaster was eying him
idly through his fly-specked window, and a group
of boys, who had been drawing pictures with their
bare toes in the deep white dust of the street,
scowled after him because his horse&#8217;s feet had
spoiled their work. His advent had left no more
impression than the tiny whirlwind in its erratic
and momentary flurry. The money for which he
had sweat blood was gone. Mechanically he
jambed his hands into his empty pockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; he said bitterly. &#8220;Hell!&#8221;</p>

<h3>SUSIE HUMBLES HERSELF TO SMITH</h3>
</div>

<p>Smith&#8217;s return to the ranch was awaited with
keen interest by several persons, though for different
reasons.</p>
<p>Bear Chief wanted to learn the whereabouts of
his race-horse, and seemed to find small comfort
in Ralston&#8217;s assurance that the proper authorities
had been notified and that every effort would be
made to locate the stolen ponies.</p>
<p>Dora was troubled that Smith&#8217;s educational
progress should have come to such an abrupt stop;
and she felt not a little hurt that he should disappear
for such a length of time without having
told her of his going, and disappointed in him,
also, that he would permit anything to interfere
with the improvement of his mind.</p>
<p>Susie&#8217;s impatience for his return increased daily.
Her chagrin over being outwitted by Smith was
almost comical. She considered it a reflection upon
her own intelligence, and tears of mortification
came to her eyes each time she discussed it with
Ralston. He urged her to be patient, and tried to
comfort her by saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;We have only to wait, Susie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I thought that before, and look what
happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The situation is different now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But maybe he&#8217;ll reform and we&#8217;ll never get
another crack at him,&#8221; she said dolefully.</p>
<p>Ralston shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let that disturb you. Take certain
natures under given circumstances, and you can
come pretty near foretelling results. Smith will do
the same thing again, only on a bigger scale; that
is, unless he learns that he has been found out. He
won&#8217;t be afraid of you, because he will think that
you are as deep in the mire as he is; but if he
thought I suspected him, or the Indians, it would
make him cautious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s charmed, or got such a
stout medicine that nobody can catch him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralston could not refrain from smiling at the
Indian superstition which cropped out at times in
Susie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for a moment,&#8221; he answered positively.
&#8220;He appears to have been fortunate&mdash;lucky&mdash;but
in a case like this, I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s any luck
can win, in the long run, against vigilance, patience,
and determination; and the greatest of these is
patience.&#8221; Ralston, waxing philosophical went on:
&#8220;It&#8217;s a great thing to be able to wait, Susie&mdash;coolly,
smilingly, to wait&mdash;providing, as the phrase
goes, you hustle while you wait. One victory for
your enemy doesn&#8217;t mean defeat for yourself. It&#8217;s
usually the last trick that counts, and sometimes
games are long in the playing. Wait for your
enemy&#8217;s head, and when it comes up, <i>whack it</i>!
Neither you nor I, Susie, have been reared to believe
that when we are swatted on one cheek we
should turn the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No;&#8221; Susie shook her head gravely. &#8220;That
ain&#8217;t sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>The person who took Smith&#8217;s absence most deeply
to heart was the Indian woman. She missed him,
and, besides, she was tormented with jealous suspicions.
She knew nothing of his life beyond what
she had seen at the ranch. There might be another
woman. She suffered from the ever-present fear
that he might not come back; that he would go
as scores of grub-liners had gone, without a word
at parting.</p>
<p>In the house she was restless, and her moccasined
feet padded often from her bench in the corner to
the window overlooking the road down which he
might come. She sat for hours at a time upon an
elevation which commanded a view of the surrounding
country. Heavy-featured, moody-eyed, she was
the personification of dog-like fidelity and patience.
Naturally, it was she who first saw Smith jogging
leisurely down the road on his jaded horse.</p>
<p>The long roof of the MacDonald ranch, which
was visible through the cool willows, looked good
to Smith. It looked peaceful, and quiet, and inviting;
yet Smith knew that the whole Indian
police force might be there to greet him. He had
been gone many days, and much might have happened
in the interim. It was characteristic of
Smith that he did not slacken his horse&#8217;s pace&mdash;he
could squirm out somehow.</p>
<p>It gave him no concern that he had not a dollar
to divide with Susie, as he had promised, and
his chagrin over the loss of the money had vanished
as he rode. His temperament was sanguine, and
soon he was telling himself that so long as there
were cattle and horses on the range there was
always a stake for him. Following up this cheerful
vein of thought, he soon felt as comfortable as
if the money were already in his pocket.</p>
<p>Smith threw up his hand in friendly greeting
as the Indian woman came down the path to meet
him.</p>
<p>There was no response, and he scowled.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old woman&#8217;s got her sull on,&#8221; he muttered,
but his voice was pleasant enough when he asked:
&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you glad to see me, Prairie Flower?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman&#8217;s face did not relax.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you been?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>He stopped unsaddling and looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never had no boss, me&mdash;Smith,&#8221; he answered
with significance.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got a woman!&#8221; she burst out fiercely.</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s brow cleared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I got a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You lie to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I call her Prairie Flower&mdash;my woman.&#8221; He
reached and took her clenched hand.</p>
<p>The tense muscles gradually relaxed, and the
darkness lifted from her face like a cloud that has
obscured the sun. She smiled and her eyelids
dropped shyly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why you go and no tell me?&#8221; she asked plaintively.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a business trip, Prairie Flower, and I
like to talk to you of love, not business,&#8221; he replied
evasively.</p>
<p>She looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I not know you have business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; I do a rushin&#8217; business&mdash;by spells.&#8221;</p>
<p>She persisted, unsatisfied:</p>
<p>&#8220;But what kind of business?&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith laughed outright.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he answered humorously, &#8220;I travels a
good deal&mdash;in the dark of the moon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Smith!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was keener than he had thought, for she
drew her right hand slyly under her left arm in the
expressive Indian sign signifying theft. He did
not answer, so she said in a tone of mingled fear
and reproach:</p>
<p>&#8220;You steal Indian horses!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>She grasped his coat-sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do dat no more! De Indians&#8217; hearts
are stirred. Dey mad. Dis time maybe dey not
ketch you, but some time, yes! You get more
brave and you steal from white man. You steal
two, t&#8217;ree cow, maybe all right, but when you
steal de white man&#8217;s horses de rope is on your neck.
I know&mdash;I have seen. Some time de thief he swing
in de wind, and de magpie pick at him, and de
coyote jump at him. Yes, I have seen it like
dat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith shivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk about them things,&#8221; he said impatiently.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been near lynchin&#8217; twice, and I
hates the looks of a slip-noose yet; but I gotta
have money.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he stood above her, looking down upon her
anxious face, a thought came to him, a plan so
simple that he was amazed that it had not occurred
to him before. Undoubtedly she had money in
the bank, this infatuated, love-sick-woman&mdash;the
Scotchman would have taught her how to save and
care for it; but if she had not, she had resources
which amounted to the same: the best of security
upon which she could borrow money. He was sure
that her cattle and horses were free of mortgages,
and there was the coming crop of hay. She had
promised him the proceeds from that, if he would
stay, but the sale of it was still months away.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had a stake, Prairie Flower,&#8221; he said
mournfully, &#8220;I&#8217;d cut out this crooked work and
quit takin&#8217; chances. But a feller like me has got
pride: he can&#8217;t go around without two bits in his
pocket, and feel like a man. If I had the price,
I&#8217;d buy me a good bunch of cattle, get a permit,
and range &#8217;em on the reserve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we get tied right,&#8221; said the woman
eagerly, &#8220;I give you de stake <i>quick</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to have the whole
country sayin&#8217; I just married you for what you
got? I&#8217;ve got some feelin&#8217;s, me&mdash;Smith, and before
I marry a rich woman, I want to have a
little somethin&#8217; of my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked pleased, for Susie&#8217;s words had
rankled.</p>
<p>&#8220;How big bunch cattle you like buy? How
much money you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head dejectedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;More money nor I can raise, Prairie Flower.
Five&mdash;ten thousand dollars&mdash;maybe more.&#8221; He
watched the effect of his words narrowly. She did
not seem startled by the size of the sums he mentioned.
He added: &#8220;There&#8217;s nothin&#8217; in monkeyin&#8217;
with just a few.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I got de money, and I gift it to you. My
heart is right to you, white man!&#8221; she said passionately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean it, Prairie Flower?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yas, but don&#8217;t tell Susie.&#8221;</p>
<p>He watched her going up the path, her hips
wobbling, her step heavy, and he hated her. Her
love irritated him; her devotion was ridiculous.
He saw in her only a means to an end, and he was
without scruples or pity.</p>
<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t no more to me nor a dumb brute,&#8221;
he said contemptuously.</p>
<p>Smith felt that he was able to foretell with considerable
accuracy the nature of his interview with
Susie upon their meeting, and her opening words
did not fall short of his expectations.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right, you are!&#8221; she said in her
high voice. &#8220;I&#8217;d stick to a pal like you through
thick and thin, I would! What did you pull out
like that for anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir, Susie, it fair broke my heart to
start off without seein&#8217; your pretty face and hearin&#8217;
your sweet voice again, but the fact is, I got
so lonesome awaitin&#8217; for you that I just naturally
had to be travellin&#8217;. I ups and hits the breeze, and
I has no pencil or paper to leave a note behind.
It wasn&#8217;t perlite, Susie, I admits,&#8221; he said mockingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dig up that money you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to divide.&#8221;
Susie looked like a young wildcat that has been
poked with a stick.</p>
<p>Smith drew an exaggerated sigh and shook his
head lugubriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Child, I&#8217;m the only son of Trouble. I gets
in a game and I loses every one of our honest,
hard-earned dollars. The tears has been pilin&#8217; out
of my eyes and down my cheeks for forty miles,
thinkin&#8217; how I&#8217;d have to break the news to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Smith, you&#8217;re just a common, <i>common</i> thief!&#8221;
All the scorn of which she was capable was in her
voice. &#8220;To steal from your own pal!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thief?&#8221; Smith put his fingers in his ears.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t use that word, Susie. It sounds horrid,
comin&#8217; from a child you love as if she was your
own step-daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The muscles of Susie&#8217;s throat contracted so it
hurt her; her face drew up in an unbecoming
grimace; she cried with a child&#8217;s abandon, indifferent
to the fact that her tears made her ludicrously
ugly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Smith,&#8221; she sobbed, &#8220;don&#8217;t you ever feel sorry
for anybody? Couldn&#8217;t you ever pity anybody?
Couldn&#8217;t you pity me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith made no reply, so she went on brokenly;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you remember that you was a kid once,
too, and didn&#8217;t know how, and couldn&#8217;t, fight grown
up people that was mean to you?&mdash;and how you
felt? I know you don&#8217;t <i>have</i> to do anything for
me&mdash;you don&#8217;t <i>have</i> to&mdash;but won&#8217;t you? Won&#8217;t
you do somethin&#8217; good when you&#8217;ve got a chance&mdash;just
this once, Smith? Won&#8217;t you go away from
here? You don&#8217;t care anything at all for Mother,
Smith, and she&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got!&#8221; She stretched her
hands toward him appealing, while the hot tears
wet her cheeks. She was the picture of childish
humiliation and misery.</p>
<p>Smith looked at her and listened without derision
or triumph. He looked at her in simple curiosity,
as he would have looked at a suffering animal
biting itself in pain. The unexpected outbreak interested
him.</p>
<p>Through a blur of tears, Susie read something
of this in his face, and her hands dropped limply
to her sides. Her appeal was useless.</p>
<p>It was not that Smith did not understand her
feelings. He did&mdash;perfectly. He knew how deep
a child&#8217;s hurt is. He had been hurt himself, and
the scar was still there. It was only that he did
not care. He had lived through his hurt, and so
would she. It was to his interest to stay, and
first and always he considered Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t say anything,&#8221; Susie said slowly,
and there was no more supplication in her voice.
&#8220;I thought I knew you before, Smith, but I know
you better now. When a white man is onery, he&#8217;s
meaner than an Injun, and that&#8217;s the kind of a
white man you are. I&#8217;ll never forget this. I&#8217;ll
never forget that I&#8217;ve crawled to you, and you
listened like a stone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith answered in a voice that was not unkind&mdash;as
he would have warned her of a sink-hole or
a bad crossing:</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t buck me, Susie, and you&#8217;d better
not try. You&#8217;re game, but you&#8217;re just a kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kids grow up sometimes;&#8221; and she turned
away.</p>
<p>McArthur, strolling, while he enjoyed his pipe,
came upon Susie lying face downward, her head
pillowed on her arm, on a sand dune not far from
the house. He thought she was asleep until she
sat up and looked at him. Then he saw her
swollen eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Susie, are you ill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m sick here.&#8221; She laid her hand upon
her heart.</p>
<p>He sat down beside her and stroked the streaked
brown hair timidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he said gently.</p>
<p>She felt the sympathy in his touch, and was
quick to respond to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pardner,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I just feel awful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Susie,&#8221; he said again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did <i>your</i> mother ever go back on you, pardner?&#8221;</p>
<p>McArthur shook his head gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Susie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s terrible. I can&#8217;t tell you hardly how it
is; but it&#8217;s like everybody that you ever cared
for in the world had died. It&#8217;s like standin&#8217; over
a quicksand and feelin&#8217; yourself goin&#8217; down. It&#8217;s
like the dreams when you wake up screamin&#8217; and
you have to tell yourself over and over it isn&#8217;t
so&mdash;except that I have to tell myself over and
over it <i>is</i> so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Susie, I think you&#8217;re wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I was wrong, but I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She worries when you are late getting home,
or are not well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s like that,&#8221; she nodded. &#8220;Mother
would fight for me like a bear with cubs if anybody
would hurt me so she could see it, but the
worst hurt&mdash;the kind that doesn&#8217;t show&mdash;I guess
she don&#8217;t understand. Before now I could tell
anybody that come on the ranch and wasn&#8217;t nice
to me to &#8217;git,&#8217; and mother would back me up.
Even yet I could tell you or Tubbs or Mr. Ralston
to leave, and they&#8217;d have to go. But Smith?&mdash;no!
He&#8217;s come back to stay. And she&#8217;ll let him
stay, if she knows it will drive me away from home.
Mother&#8217;s Injun, and she can only read a little and
write a little that my Dad taught her, and she
wears blankets and moccasins, but I never was
&#8217;shamed of Mother before. If she marries Smith,
what can I do? Where can I go? I could take
my pack outfit and start out to hunt Dad&#8217;s folks,
but if Mother marries Smith, she&#8217;ll need me after
a while. Yet how can I stay? I feel sometimes
like they was two of me&mdash;one was good and one
was bad; and if Mother lets Smith turn me out,
maybe all the bad in me would come to the top.
But there&#8217;s one thing I couldn&#8217;t forget. Dad used
to say to me lots of times when we were alone&mdash;oh,
often he said it: &#8216;Susie, girl, never forget
you&#8217;re a MacDonald!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>McArthur turned quickly and looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did your father say that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he always straightened himself and said
it just like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>McArthur was studying her face with a peculiar
intentness, as if he were seeing her for the first
time.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was his first name, Susie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Donald.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Donald MacDonald?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; there was lots of MacDonalds up there
in the north country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a picture, Susie?&#8221;</p>
<p>A rifle-shot broke the stillness of the droning
afternoon. Susie was on her feet the instant.
There was another&mdash;then a fusillade!</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Indians after Smith!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;They promised me they wouldn&#8217;t! Come&mdash;stand
up here where you can see.&#8221;</p>
<p>McArthur took a place beside her on a knoll
and watched the scene with horrified eyes. The
Indians were grouped, with Bear Chief in advance.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re shootin&#8217; into the stable! They&#8217;ve got
him cornered,&#8221; Susie explained excitedly. &#8220;No&mdash;look!
He&#8217;s comin&#8217; out! He&#8217;s goin&#8217; to make a
run for it! He&#8217;s headed for the house. He can
run like a scared wolf!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do they mean to kill him?&#8221; McArthur asked
in a shocked voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure they mean to kill him. Do you think
that&#8217;s target practice? But look where the dust
flies up&mdash;they&#8217;re striking all around him&mdash;behind
him&mdash;beside him&mdash;everywhere but in him! They&#8217;re
so anxious that they&#8217;re shootin&#8217; wild. Runnin&#8217;
Rabbit ought to get him&mdash;he&#8217;s a good shot! He
<i>did</i>! No, he stumbled. He&#8217;s charmed&mdash;that Smith.
He&#8217;s got a strong medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not too brave to run,&#8221; said McArthur,
but added: &#8220;I ran, myself, when they were after
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d better run,&#8221; Susie replied. &#8220;But he&#8217;s
after his gun; he means to fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll make it!&#8221; McArthur cried.</p>
<p>Susie&#8217;s voice suddenly rang out in an ascending,
staccato-like shriek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Oh! Oh! Mother, go back!&#8221; but the cracking
rifles drowned Susie&#8217;s shrill cry of entreaty.</p>
<p>The Indian woman, with her hands high above
her head, the palms open as if to stop the singing
bullets, rushed from the house and stopped only
when she had passed Smith and stood between him
and danger. She stood erect, unflinching, and
while the Indians&#8217; fire wavered Smith gained the
doorway.</p>
<p>Gasping for breath, his short upper lip drawn
back from his protruding teeth in the snarl of
a ferocious animal, he snatched a rifle from the
deer-horn gun-rack above the door.</p>
<p>The Indian woman was directly in line between
him and his enemies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out of the way!&#8221; he yelled, but she did
not hear him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fool!&#8221; he snarled. &#8220;The fool! I&#8217;ll have
to crease her.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lifted his rifle and deliberately shot her in
the fleshy part of her arm near the shoulder.
She whirled with the shock of it, and dropped.</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2>
<h3>A BAD HOMBRE</h3>
</div>

<p>The Indians ceased firing when the woman
fell, and when Susie reached her mother Smith
was helping her to her feet, and it was Smith
who led her into the house and ripped her sleeve.</p>
<p>It was only a painful flesh-wound, but if the
bullet had gone a few inches higher it would have
shattered her shoulder. It was a shot which told
Smith that he had lost none of his accuracy of
aim.</p>
<p>He always carried a small roll of bandages in
his hip-pocket, and with these he dressed the
woman&#8217;s arm with surprising skill.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you needs a bandage, you generally
needs it bad,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>He wondered if she knew that it was his shot
which had struck her. If she did know, she said
nothing, though her eyes, bright with pain, followed
his every movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like somebody&#8217;s squeaked,&#8221; Smith said
meaningly to Susie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody&#8217;s squeaked,&#8221; she lied glibly. &#8220;They&#8217;re
mad, and they&#8217;re suspicious, but they didn&#8217;t see
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;d go after me like that on suspicion,&#8221;
said Smith dryly, &#8220;looks like they&#8217;d be plumb
hos-tile if they was sure. Is this here war goin&#8217;
to keep up, or has they had satisfaction?&#8221;</p>
<p>Through Susie, a kind of armistice was arranged
between Smith and the Indians. It took much
argument to induce them to defer their vengeance
and let the law take its course.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll only get in trouble,&#8221; she urged, &#8220;and
Mr. Ralston will see that Smith gets all that&#8217;s
comin&#8217; to him when he has enough proof. He&#8217;s
stole more than horses from me,&#8221; she said bitterly,
&#8220;and if I can wait and trust the white man to
handle him as he thinks best, you can, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the Indians reluctantly withdrew, but both
Smith and Susie knew that their smouldering resentment
was ready to break out again upon the slightest
provocation.</p>
<p>Susie&#8217;s assurance that the attack of the Indians
was due only to suspicion did not convince Smith.
He noticed that, with the exception of Yellow
Bird, there was not a single Indian stopping at
the ranch, and Yellow Bird not only refused to
be drawn into friendly conversation, but distinctly
avoided him.</p>
<p>Smith knew that he was now upon dangerous
ground, yet, with his unfaltering faith in himself
and his luck, he continued to walk with a firm
tread. If he could make one good turn and get
the Indian woman&#8217;s stake, he told himself, then
he and Dora could look for a more healthful
clime.</p>
<p>The Schoolmarm never had appeared more trim,
more self-respecting, more desirable, than when in
her clean, white shirt-waist and well-cut skirt she
stepped forward to greet him with a friendly, outstretched
hand. His heart beat wildly as he took it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid you had gone &#8216;for keeps,&#8217;&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you <i>afraid</i>?&#8221; he asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly afraid, to be more explicit, but I
should have been sorry.&#8221; She smiled up into his
face with her frank, ingenuous smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were getting along so well with your
lessons. Besides, I should have thought it unfriendly
of you to go without saying good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfriendly?&#8221; Smith laughed shortly. &#8220;Me
unfriendly! Why, girl, you&#8217;re like a mountain to
me. When I&#8217;m tired and hot and all give out, I
raises my eyes and sees you there above me&mdash;quiet
and cool and comfortable, like&mdash;and I takes a fresh
grip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I help you,&#8221; Dora replied gently.
&#8220;I want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in the way of makin&#8217; a stake now,&#8221; Smith
went on, &#8220;and when I gets it&#8221;&mdash;he hesitated&mdash;&#8220;well,
when I gets it I aims to let you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Dora went into the house, to her own
room, Smith stepped into the living-room, where
the Indian woman sat by the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;You like dat white woman better den me?&#8221;
she burst out as he entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prairie Flower,&#8221; he replied wearily, &#8220;if I had
a dollar for every time I&#8217;ve answered that question,
I wouldn&#8217;t be lookin&#8217; for no stake to buy cattle
with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;De white woman couldn&#8217;t give you no stake.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made no reply to her taunt. He was thinking.
The words of a cowpuncher came back to
him as he sat and regarded with unseeing eyes the
Indian woman. The cowpuncher had said: &#8220;When
a feller rides the range month in and month out,
and don&#8217;t see nobody but other punchers and Injuns,
some Mary Moonbeam or Sally Star-eyes begins
to look kind of good to him when he rides
into camp and she smiles as if she was glad he
had come. He gits used to seein&#8217; her sittin&#8217; on
an antelope hide, beadin&#8217; moccasins, and the country
where they wear pointed-toed shoes and sit in
chairs gits farther and farther away. And after
awhile he tells himself that he don&#8217;t mind smoke
and the smell of buckskin, and a tepee is a better
home nor none, and that he thinks as much of this
here Mary Moonbeam or Sally Star-eyes as he could
think of any woman, and he wonders when the
priest could come. And while he&#8217;s studyin&#8217; it over,
some white girl cuts across his trail, and, with the
sight of her, Mary Moonbeam or Sally Star-eyes
looks like a dirty two-spot in a clean deck.&#8221; The
cowpuncher&#8217;s words came back to Smith as though
they had been said only yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you say what you think?&#8221; the
woman asked, uneasy under his long stare.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Smith, rousing himself; &#8220;the
Schoolmarm couldn&#8217;t give me no stake; and money
talks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you want your money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much you got?&#8221; he asked bluntly. He
was sure of her, and he was in no mood to finesse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eight&mdash;nine thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to do anything with cattle this
year, I want to get at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I give you de little paper MacDonald call
check. I know how to write check,&#8221; she said
with pride.</p>
<p>Smith shook his head. A check was evidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s better for you to go to the bank and get
the cash yourself. Meeteetse can hitch up and take
you. It won&#8217;t bother your arm none, for you ain&#8217;t
bad hurt. Nine thousand is quite a wad to get
without givin&#8217; notice, and I doubt if you gets it,
but draw all you can. Take a flour-sack along
and put the stuff in it; then when you gets home,
pass it over to me first chance. Don&#8217;t let &#8217;em
load you down with silver&mdash;I hates to pack silver
on horseback.&#8221;</p>
<p>To all of which instructions the woman agreed.</p>
<p>That she might avoid Susie&#8217;s questions, she did
not start the next morning until Susie was well
on her way to school. Then, dressed in her gaudiest
skirt, her widest brass-studded belt, her best and
hottest blanket, she was ready for the long drive.</p>
<p>Smith put a fresh bandage on her arm, and
praised the scrawling signature on the check which
she had filled out after laborious and oft-repeated
efforts. He made sure that she had the flour-sack,
and that the check was pinned securely inside
her capacious pocket, before he helped her in the
wagon. He had been all attention that morning,
and her eyes were liquid with gratitude and devotion
as she and Meeteetse drove away. She turned
before they were out of sight, and her face brightened
when she saw Smith still looking after them.
She thought comfortably of the fast approaching
day when she would be envied by the women who
had married only &#8220;bloods&#8221; or &#8220;breeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith, as it happened, was remarking contemptuously
to Tubbs, as he nodded after the disappearing
wagon:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t that look like a reg&#8217;lar Injun outfit?
One old white horse and a spotted buzzard-head;
harness wired up with Mormon beeswax; a lopsided
spring seat; one side-board gone and no
paint on the wagon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d think Meeteetse&#8217;d think more of hisself
than to go ridin&#8217; around with a blanket-squaw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He <i>said</i> he was out of tobacer, but he probably
aims to get drunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More&#8217;n likely,&#8221; Tubbs agreed. &#8220;Meeteetse&#8217;s
gittin&#8217; to be a reg&#8217;lar squawman anyhow, hangin&#8217;
around Injuns so much and runnin&#8217; with &#8217;em. He
believes in signs and dreams, and he ain&#8217;t washed
his neck for six weeks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Associatin&#8217; too much with Injuns will spile a
good man. Tubbs,&#8221; Smith went on solemnly, &#8220;you
ain&#8217;t the feller you was when you come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knows it,&#8221; Tubbs agreed plaintively. &#8220;I
hain&#8217;t half the gumption I had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It hurts me to see a bright mind like yours
goin&#8217; to seed, and there&#8217;s nothin&#8217;ll do harm to a
feller quicker nor associatin&#8217; with them as ain&#8217;t his
equal. Tubbs, like you was my own brother, I says
that bug-hunter ain&#8217;t no man for you to run with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t vicious and the likes o&#8217; that,&#8221; said
Tubbs, in mild defense of his employer.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s &#8217;vicious&#8217; anyhow?&#8221; demanded Smith.
&#8220;Who&#8217;s goin&#8217; to say what&#8217;s vicious and what ain&#8217;t?
I says it&#8217;s vicious to lie like he does about them
idjot skulls and ham-bones he digs out and brings
home, makin&#8217; out that they might be pieces of
fellers what could use one of them cotton-woods for
a walkin&#8217; stick and et animals the size of that
meat-house at a meal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He never said jest that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He might as well. What I&#8217;m aimin&#8217; at is that
it&#8217;s demoralizin&#8217; to get interested in things like
that and spend your life diggin&#8217; up the dead. It&#8217;s
too tame for a feller of any spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nowise dang&#8217;rous,&#8221; Tubbs admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I thought you was my kind, Tubbs, I&#8217;d
give you a chance. I&#8217;d let you in on a deal that&#8217;d
be the makin&#8217; of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All I needs is a chanct,&#8221; Tubbs declared
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you,&#8221; Smith replied, with flattering
emphasis.</p>
<p>A disturbing thought made Tubbs inquire
anxiously:</p>
<p>&#8220;This here chanct your speakin&#8217; of&mdash;it ain&#8217;t
work, is it?&mdash;real right-down work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not degradin&#8217; work, like pitchin&#8217; hay or
plowin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hates low-down work, where you gits out
and sweats.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see where you&#8217;re right. There&#8217;s no call for
a man of your sand and <i>sabe</i> to do day&#8217;s work.
Let them as hasn&#8217;t neither and is afraid to take
chances pitch hay and do plowin&#8217; for wages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tubbs looked a little startled.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of chances?&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith looked at Tubbs before he lowered his
voice and asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t you ever on the rustle none?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tubbs reflected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Onct back east, in I-ó-wa, I rustled me a set
of underwear off&#8217;n a clothes-line.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith eyed Tubbs in genuine disgust. He had
all the contempt for a petty-larceny thief that the
skilled safe-breaker has for the common purse-snatcher.
The line between pilfering and legitimate
stealing was very clear in his mind. He said
merely,</p>
<p>&#8220;Tubbs, I believe you&#8217;re a bad <i>hombre</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They <i>is</i> worse, I s&#8217;pose,&#8221; said Tubbs modestly,
&#8220;but I&#8217;ve been pretty rank in my time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you ride? Can you rope? Can you cut
out a steer and burn a brand? Would you get
buck-ague in a pinch and quit me if it came to a
show-down? Are you a stayer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try me,&#8221; said Tubbs, swelling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shake,&#8221; said Smith. &#8220;I wisht we&#8217;d got
acquainted sooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And mebby I kin tell you somethin&#8217; about
brands,&#8221; Tubbs went on boastfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;More&#8217;n likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I kin take a wet blanket and a piece of copper
wire and put an addition to an old brand so it&#8217;ll
last till you kin git the stock off&#8217;n your hands.
I&#8217;ve never done it, but I&#8217;ve see it done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard tell of somethin&#8217; like that,&#8221; Smith
replied dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Er you kin draw out a brand so you never
would know nothin&#8217; was there. You take a chunk
of green cottonwood, and saw it off square; then
you bile it and bile it, and when it&#8217;s hot through,
you slaps it on the brand, and when you lifts it
up after while the brand is drawed out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you dream that, Tubbs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I b&#8217;leeve it&#8217;ll work,&#8221; declared Tubbs stoutly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it would work in I-ó-wa,&#8221; said Smith,
&#8220;but I doubts if it would work here. Any way,&#8221;
he added conciliatingly, &#8220;we&#8217;ll give it a try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And this chanct&mdash;it&#8217;s tolable safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same as if you was home in bed. When I says
&#8217;ready,&#8217; will you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch my smoke,&#8221; answered Tubbs.</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s eyes followed Tubbs&#8217;s hulking figure as
he shambled off, and his face was full of derision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say&#8221;&mdash;he addressed the world in general&mdash;&#8220;you
show me a man from I-ó-wa or Nebrasky and
I&#8217;ll show you a son-of-a-gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tubbs was putty in the hands of Smith, who
could play upon his vanity and ignorance to any
degree&mdash;though he believed that beyond a certain
point Tubbs was an arrant coward. But Smith
had a theory regarding the management of cowards.
He believed that on the same principle that
one uses a whip on a scared horse&mdash;to make it
more afraid of that which is behind than of that
which is ahead&mdash;he could by threats and intimidations
force Tubbs to do his bidding if the occasion
arose. Tubbs&#8217;s mental calibre was 22-short; but
Smith needed help, and Tubbs seemed the most
pliable material at hand. That Tubbs had pledged
himself to something the nature of which he knew
only vaguely, was in itself sufficient to receive
Smith&#8217;s contempt. He had learned from observation
that little dependence can be placed upon
those who accept responsibilities too readily and
lightly, but he was confident that he could utilize
Tubbs as long as he should need him, and after
that&mdash;Smith shrugged his shoulders&mdash;what was an
I-ó-wan more or less?</p>
<p>Altogether, he felt well satisfied with what he
had accomplished in the short while since his
return.</p>
<p>When Susie came home from school, Smith was
looking through the corral-fence at a few ponies
which Ralston had bought and driven in, to give
color to his story.</p>
<p>&#8220;See anything there you&#8217;d like?&#8221; she inquired,
with significant emphasis.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d buy the bunch if I was goin&#8217; to set me
some bear-traps.&#8221; Smith could see nothing to
praise in anything which belonged to Ralston.</p>
<p>Susie missed her mother immediately upon going
into the house, and in their sleeping-room she saw
every sign of a hurried departure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s mother gone?&#8221; she asked Ling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To town? To see a doctor about her arm?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beads.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beads?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blue beads, gleen beads. She no have enough
beads for finish moccasin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When&#8217;s she comin&#8217; home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She come &#8217;night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Forty miles over a rough road, with her bandaged
arm, for beads! It did not sound reasonable
to Susie, but since Smith was accounted for, and
her mother would return that night, there seemed
no cause for worry. Susie could not remember
ever before having come home without finding her
mother somewhere in the house, and now, as she
fidgeted about, she realized how much she would
miss her if that which she most feared should
transpire to separate them.</p>
<p>She walked to the door, and while she stood idly
kicking her heel against the door-sill she saw
Ralston, who was passing, stoop and pick up a
scrap of paper which had been caught between
two small stones. She observed that he examined
it with interest, but while he stood with his lips
pursed in a half-whistle a puff of wind flirted it
from his fingers. He pursued it as though it had
value, and Susie, who was not above curiosity,
joined in the chase.</p>
<p>It lodged in one of the giant sage-brushes which
grew some little distance away on the outer edge
of the dooryard, and into this brush Ralston
reached and carefully drew it forth. He looked
at it again, lest his eyes had deceived him, then he
passed it to Susie, who stared blankly from the
scrap of paper to him.</p>

<h3>WHEN THE CLOUDS PLAYED WOLF</h3>
</div>

<p>The Indian woman was restless; she had been
so from the time they had lost sight of the town,
but her restlessness had increased as the daylight
faded and night fell.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re goin&#8217; to bust this seat in if you don&#8217;t
quit jammin&#8217; around,&#8221; Meeteetse Ed warned her
peevishly.</p>
<p>Meeteetse was irritable, a state due largely to
the waning exhilaration of a short and unsatisfactory
spree.</p>
<p>The woman clucked at the horses, and, to the
great annoyance of her driver, reached for the
reins and slapped them on the back.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re about played out,&#8221; he growled.
&#8220;Forty miles is a awful trip for these buzzard-heads
to make in a day. We orter have put up
some&#8217;eres overnight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could have stayed with Little Coyote&#8217;s
woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We orter have done it, too. Look at them
cayuses stumblin&#8217; along! Say, we won&#8217;t git in before
&#8217;leven or twelve at this gait, and I&#8217;m so
hungry I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to sleep
to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Coyote&#8217;s woman gifted me some sa&#8217;vis
berries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, sa&#8217;vis berries! I can&#8217;t go sa&#8217;vis berries,&#8221;
growled Meeteetse. &#8220;They&#8217;re too sweet. The only
way they&#8217;re fit to eat is to dry &#8217;em and pound &#8217;em
up with jerked elk&mdash;then they ain&#8217;t bad eatin&#8217;.
I&#8217;ve et &#8217;most ev&#8217;ry thing in my day. I&#8217;ve et wolf,
and dog, and old mountain billy-goat, and bull-snakes,
and grasshoppers, so you kin see I ain&#8217;t
finnicky, but I can&#8217;t stummick sa&#8217;vis berries.&#8221; He
asked querulously: &#8220;What&#8217;s ailin&#8217; of you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian woman, who had been studying the
black clouds as they drifted across the sky to dim
the starlight, said in a half-whisper:</p>
<p>&#8220;The clouds no look good to me. They look
like enemies playin&#8217; wolf. I feel as if somethin&#8217;
goin&#8217; happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bare suggestion of the supernatural was
sufficient to alarm Meeteetse. He asked in a
startled voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you feel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel sad. My heart drags down to de ground,
and it seem like de dark hide somethin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meeteetse elongated his neck and peered fearfully
into the darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think it hides?&#8221; he asked in a
husky whisper.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but I have de bad feelin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot to sleep with my feet crossed last
night,&#8221; said Meeteetse, &#8220;and I dreamed horrible
dreams all night long. Maybe they was warnin&#8217;s.
I can&#8217;t think of anything much that could happen
to us though,&#8221; he went on, having forgotten some
of his ill-nature in his alarm for his personal
safety. &#8220;These here horses ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to run
away&mdash;I wisht they would, fer &#8217;t would git us
quite a piece on our road. We ain&#8217;t no enemies
worth mentionin&#8217;, and we ain&#8217;t worth stealin&#8217;, so
I don&#8217;t hardly think your feelin&#8217; means any wrong
for us. More&#8217;n likely it&#8217;s jest somebody dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>This thought, slightly consoling to Meeteetse,
did not seem to comfort the Indian woman, who
continued to squirm on the rickety seat and to
strain her eyes into the darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anybody ud come along and want to mix
with me&mdash;say, do you see that fist? If ever I hit
anybody with that fist, they&#8217;ll have to have it dug
out of &#8217;em. I don&#8217;t row often, but when I does&mdash;oh,
lordy! lordy! I jest raves and caves. I was
home on a visit onct, and my old-maid aunt gits
a notion of pickin&#8217; on me. Say, I ups and runs
her all over the house with an axe! I&#8217;m more er
less a dang&#8217;rous character when I&#8217;m on the peck.
Is that feelin&#8217; workin off of you any?&#8221; he inquired
anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It comes stronger,&#8221; she answered, and her grip
tightened on the flour-sack she held under her
blanket.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wisht I knowed what it was. I&#8217;m gittin&#8217; all
strung up myself.&#8221; His popping eyes ached from
trying to see into the darkness around them. &#8220;If
we kin git past them gulches onct! That ud be
a dum bad place to roll off the side. We&#8217;d go
kerplunk into the crick-bottom. Gosh! what was
that?&#8221; He stopped the weary horses with a terrific
jerk.</p>
<p>It was only a little night prowler which had
scurried under the horses&#8217; feet and rustled into the
brush.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see how on aidge I am! I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221;
he went on garrulously&mdash;the sound of his own voice
was always pleasant to Meeteetse: &#8220;I take more
stock in signs and feelin&#8217;s than most people, for I&#8217;ve
seen &#8217;em work out. Down there in Hermosy there
was a feller made a stake out&#8217;n a silver prospect,
and he takes it into his head to go back to Nebrasky
and hunt up his wife, that he&#8217;d run off and left
some time prev&#8217;ous. As the date gits clost for
him to leave, he got glummer and glummer. He&#8217;d
skerce crack a smile. The night before the stage
was comin&#8217; to git him, he was settin&#8217; in a &#8217;dobe
with a dirt roof, rared back on the hind legs of
his chair, with his hands in his pockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Boys,&#8217; he says, &#8216;I&#8217;ll never git back to
Genevieve. I feels it; I knows it; I&#8217;ll bet you
any amount I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to cash in between here
and Nebrasky. I&#8217;ve seen myself in my coffin four
times hand-runnin&#8217;, when I was wide awake.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody had their mouths open to let out
a holler and laff when jest then one of the biggest
terrantuler that I ever see dropped down out&#8217;n
the dirt and straw and lands on his bald head. It
hangs on and bites &#8217;fore anybody kin bresh it off,
and, &#8217;fore Gawd, he ups and dies while the medicine
shark is comin&#8217; from the next town!&#8221;</p>
<p>His companion did not find Meeteetse&#8217;s reminiscence
specially interesting, possibly because she had
heard it before, so at its conclusion she made no
comment, but continued to watch with anxious eyes
the clouds and the road ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now if that ud been me,&#8221; Meeteetse started
to say, in nowise disconcerted by the unresponsiveness
of his listener&mdash;&#8220;if that ud&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Throw up your hands!&#8221; The curt command
came out of the night with the startling distinctness
of a gun-shot. The horses were thrown back
on their haunches by a figure at their head.</p>
<p>Meeteetse not only threw up his hands, but his
feet. He threw them up so high and so hard
that he lost his equilibrium, and, as a result, the
ill-balanced seat went over, carrying with it
Meeteetse and the Indian woman.</p>
<p>The latter&#8217;s mind acted quickly. She knew that
her errand to the bank had become known. Undoubtedly
they had been followed from town. As
soon as she could disentangle herself from
Meeteetse&#8217;s convulsive embrace, she threw the flour-sack
from her with all her strength, hoping it
would drop out of sight in the sage-brush. It was
caught in mid-air by a tall figure at the wagon-side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, madam,&#8221; said a hollow voice,
&#8220;Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was all done so quickly and neatly that
Meeteetse and the Indian woman were still in the
bottom of the wagon when two dark figures clattered
past and vanishing hoof-beats told them the
thieves were on their way to town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir!&#8221; Meeteetse found his feet, also his
tongue, at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir!&#8221; He adjusted the seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir!&#8221; He picked up the reins and
clucked to the horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir! I know &#8217;em. Them&#8217;s the fellers
that held up the Great Northern!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian woman said not a word. Her heart
was filled with despair. What would Smith say?
was her thought. What would he do? She felt
intuitively how great would be his disappointment.
How could she tell him?</p>
<p>She drew the blanket tighter about her shoulders
and across her face, crouching on the seat like a
culprit.</p>
<p>The ranch-house was dark when they drove into
the yard, for which she was thankful. She left
Meeteetse to unharness, and, without striking a
light or speaking to Susie, crept between her
blankets like a frightened child.</p>
<p>Smith, in his dreams, had heard the rumble of
the wagon as it crossed the ford, and he awoke
the next morning with a sensation of pleasurable
anticipation. In his mind&#8217;s eye, he saw the banknotes
in a heap before him. There were all kinds
in the picture&mdash;greasy ones, crisp ones, tattered
bills pasted together with white strips of paper.
He rather liked these best, because the care with
which they had been preserved conveyed an idea
of value. They had been treasured, coveted by
others, counted often.</p>
<p>Eager, animated, his eyes bright, his lips curving
in a smile, Smith hurried into his clothes and
to the ranch-house, to seek the Indian woman. He
heard her heavy step as she crossed the floor of
the living-room, and he waited outside the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prairie Flower!&#8221; he whispered as she stood
before him.</p>
<p>She avoided his eyes, and her fingers fumbled
nervously with the buckle of her wide belt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you get it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221; His eyes gleamed with the
light of avarice.</p>
<p>She drew in her breath hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was stole.&#8221;</p>
<p>His face went blood-red; the cords of his neck
swelled as if he were straining at a weight. She
shrank from the snarling ferocity of his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;You lie!&#8221; The voice was not human.</p>
<p>He clenched his huge fist and knocked her down.</p>
<p>She was on the ground when Susie came out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman blinked up at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I slip. I gettin&#8217; too fat,&#8221; she said, and
struggled to her feet.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, with great minuteness of detail,
Meeteetse was describing the exciting incident of
the night, and what would have happened if only
he could have laid hold of his gun.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; split the wind if I
could have jest drawed my automatic in time! As
&#8217;twas, I put up the best fight I could, with a
woman screamin&#8217; and hangin&#8217; to me for pertection.
I rastled the big feller around in the road there
for some time, neither of us able to git a good
holt. He was glad enough to break away, I kin
tell you. They&#8217;s no manner o&#8217; doubt in my mind
but them was the Great Northern hold-ups.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what would they tackle <i>you</i> for?&#8221; demanded
Old Man Rulison. &#8220;Everybody knows <i>you</i>
ain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217;, and you say all they took from
the old woman was a flour-sack full of dried sa&#8217;vis
berries. It&#8217;s some of a come-down, looks to me,
from robbing trains to stealin&#8217; stewin&#8217;-fruit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there you are.&#8221; Meeteetse shrugged his
shoulders. &#8220;That&#8217;s your mystery. All I knows
is, that I pulled ha&#8217;r every jump in the road to
save them berries.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still breathing hard, Smith hunted Tubbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tubbs, will you be ready for business, to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The sooner, the quicker,&#8221; Tubbs answered,
with his vacuous wit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know the gulch where they found that
dead Injun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saddle up and meet me over there as quick
as you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right.&#8221; Tubbs winked knowingly, and immediately
after breakfast started to do as he was
bid.</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s face was not good to look upon as he
sat at the table. He took no part in the conversation,
and scarcely touched the food before
him. His disappointment was so deep that it
actually sickened him, and his unreasoning anger
toward the woman was so great that he wanted to
get out of her sight and her presence. She was
like a dog which after a whipping tries to curry
favor with its master. She was ready to go to
him at the first sign of relenting. She felt no
resentment because of his injustice and brutality.
She felt nothing but that he was angry at her,
that he kept his eyes averted and repelled her
timid advances. Her heart ached, and she would
have grovelled at his feet, had he permitted her.
In her desperation, she made up her mind to try
on him the love-charm of the Sioux women. It
might soften his heart toward her. She would
have sacrificed anything and all to bring him back.</p>
<p>Smith was glad to get away into the hills for
a time. He was filled with a feverish impatience
to bring about that which he so much desired. The
picture of the ranch-house with the white curtains
at the windows became more and more attractive
to him as he dwelt upon it. He looked upon it
as a certainty, one which could not be too quickly
realized to please him. Then, too, the atmosphere
of the MacDonald ranch had grown distasteful to
him. With that sudden revulsion of feeling which
was characteristic, he had grown tired of the place,
he wanted a change, to be on the move again;
but, of more importance than these things, he
sensed hostility in the air. There was something
significant in the absence of the Indians at the
ranch. There was an ominous quiet hanging over
the place that chilled him. He had a feeling that
he was being followed, without being able to detect
so much as a shadow. He felt as if the world
were full of eyes&mdash;glued upon him. Sudden sounds
startled him, and he had found himself peering into
dark stable corners and stooping to look where the
shadows lay black in the thick creek-brush.</p>
<p>He told himself that the trip through the Bad
Lands had unnerved him, but the explanation was
not satisfying. Through it all, he had an underlying
feeling that something was wrong; yet he
had no thought of altering his plans. He wanted
money, and he wanted Dora. The combination was
sufficient to nerve him to take chances.</p>
<p>Tubbs was waiting in the gulch. Smith looked
at the spot where White Antelope&#8217;s body had lain,
and reflected that it was curious how long the black
stain of blood would stay on sand and gravel.
He had been lucky to get out of that scrape so
easily, he told himself as he rode by.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you know what you&#8217;re up against,
feller,&#8221; he said bluntly, as he and Tubbs met.</p>
<p>&#8220;I inclines to the opinion that it&#8217;s a little cattle
deal,&#8221; Tubbs replied facetiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You inclines right. Now, here&#8217;s our play&mdash;listen.
The Bar C outfit is workin&#8217; up in the mountains,
so they won&#8217;t interfere with us none, and
about three or three and a half days&#8217; drive from
here there&#8217;s some fellers what&#8217;ll take &#8217;em off our
hands. We gets our wad and divvies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for a hand do I take?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By rights, maybe, we ought to do our work
at night, but I&#8217;ve rode over the country, and it
looks safe enough to drive &#8217;em into the gulch to-day.
They isn&#8217;t a human in sight, and if one
shows up, I reckon you know what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds easy enough, if it works,&#8221; said
Tubbs dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it works? Feller, if you&#8217;ve got a yeller
streak, you better quit right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I merely means,&#8221; Tubbs hastened to explain,
&#8220;that it sounds so easy that it makes me sore
we wasn&#8217;t doin&#8217; it before.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reply appeared to pacify Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hates to fool with cattle,&#8221; he admitted,
&#8220;&#8217;specially these here Texas brutes that spread
out, leavin&#8217; tracks all over the flat, and they can&#8217;t
make time just off green grass. Gimme horses&mdash;but
horses ain&#8217;t safe right now, with the Injuns
riled up. Now, you start out and gather up what
you can, and hold &#8217;em here till I get back. I&#8217;ll
go to the ranch and get a little grub together and
get here as quick as it&#8217;s safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith galloped back to the ranch, to learn that
Dora had ridden to the Agency to spend the day.
He was keenly disappointed that he had missed the
opportunity of saying good-by. She had chided
him before for not telling her of his contemplated
absence, and he had promised not to neglect to
do so again; for she was in the habit of arranging
the table for her night-school and waiting
until he came. Then it occurred to Smith that
he might write. He was delighted with the idea,
and undoubtedly Dora would be equally delighted
to receive a letter from him. It would
show her that he remembered his promise, and also
give her a chance to note his progress. Since Smith
had learned that a capital letter is used to designate
the personal pronoun, and that a period is
placed at such points as one&#8217;s breath gives out,
he had begun to think himself something of a
scholar.</p>
<p>His enthusiasm grew as he thought of it, and
he decided that while he was about it he would
write a genuine love-letter.</p>
<p>Borrowing paper, an erratic pen, and ink pale
from frequent watering, from a shelf in the living-room,
he repaired to the dining-room table and
gave himself up to the throes of composition.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that the superlative of dear
is dearest, he wrote:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dearest Girl</span>.</p>
<p>I have got to go away on bizness. I had
ought to hav said good-by but I cant wate till
you gets back so I thort I wold write. I love
you. I hates everyboddy else when I think of
you. I dont love no other woman but you. Nor
never did. If ever I go away and dont come back
dont forget what I say because I will be ded, I
mean it. I will hav a stak perty quick then I
will show you this aint no josh. You no the
rest, good-by for this time.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Smith</span>.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>The perspiration stood out on his forehead, and
he wiped it away with his ink-stained fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Writin&#8217; is harder work nor shoein&#8217; a horse,&#8221;
he observed to Ling, and added for the Indian
woman&#8217;s benefit, &#8220;I&#8217;m sendin&#8217; off to get me a pair
of them Angory saddle-pockets.&#8221;</p>
<p>His explanation did not deceive the person for
whom it was intended. With the intuition of a
jealous woman, she knew that he was writing a
letter which he would not have her see. She meant
to know, if possible, to whom he was writing, and
what. Although she did not raise her eyes from
her work when he replaced the pen and ink, she
did not let him out of her sight. She believed
that he had written to Dora, and she was sure of
it when, thinking himself unobserved, he crept to
Dora&#8217;s open window, outside of the house, and
dropped the letter into the top drawer of her
bureau, which stood close.</p>
<p>As soon as Smith was out of sight, she too crept
stealthily to the open window. A red spot burned
on either swarthy cheek, and her aching heart beat
fast. She took the letter from the drawer, and,
going toward the creek, plunged into the willows,
with the instinct of the wounded animal seeking
cover.</p>
<p>The woman could read a little&mdash;not much, but
better than she could write. She had been to the
Mission when she was younger, and MacDonald
had labored patiently to teach her more. Now,
concealed among the willows, sitting cross-legged
on the ground, she spelled out Smith&#8217;s letter word
by word,</p>
<p>I love you. I hates everyboddy else when I
think of you. I don&#8217;t love no other woman but
you. Nor never did.</p>
<p>She read it slowly, carefully, each word sinking
deep. Then she stroked her hair with long,
deliberate strokes, and read it again.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t love no other woman but you. Nor
never did.</p>
<p>She laid the letter on the ground, and, folding
her arms, rocked her body to and fro, as though
in physical agony. When she shut her lips they
trembled as they touched each other, but she made
no sound. The wound in her arm was beginning
to heal. It itched, and she scratched it hard,
for the pain served as a kind of counter-irritant.
A third time she read the letter, stroking her
hair incessantly with the long, deliberate strokes.
Then she folded it, and, reaching for a pointed
stick, dug a hole in the soft dirt. In the bottom
of the hole she laid the letter and covered it with
earth, patting and smoothing it until it was level.
Before she left she sprinkled a few leaves over
the spot.</p>
<p>She looked old and ugly when she went into
the house, seeming, for the first time, the woman
of middle-age that she was. Quietly, purposefully,
she drew out a chair, and, standing upon it, took
down from the rafters the plant which Little
Coyote&#8217;s woman, the Mandan, had given her. It
had hung there a long time, and the leaves crumpled
and dropped off at her touch. She filled a basin
with water and put the plant and root to soak,
while she searched for a sharp knife. Turning her
back to the room and facing the corner, like a
child in mischief, she peeled the outer bark from
the root with the greatest care. The inner bark
was blood-red, and this too she peeled away carefully,
very, very carefully saving the smallest
particles, and laid it upon a paper. When she
had it all, she burned the plant; but the red inner
bark she put in a tin cup and covered it with
boiling water, to steep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch dat,&#8221; she warned Ling.</p>
<p>The afternoon was waning when she went again
to the willows, but the air was still hot, for the
rocks and sand held the heat until well after nightfall.
In the willows she cut a stick&mdash;a forked stick,
which she trimmed so that it left a crotch with a
long handle. Hiding the stick under her blanket,
she stepped out of the willows, and seemed to be
wandering aimlessly until she was out of sight of
the house and the bunk-house. Then she walked
rapidly, with a purpose. Her objective point was
a hill covered so thickly with rocks that scarcely
a spear of grass grew upon it. The climb left
her short of breath, she wiped the perspiration
from her face with her blanket, but she did not
falter. Stepping softly, listening, she crept over
the rocks with the utmost caution, peering here
and there as if in search of something which she
did not wish to alarm. A long, sibilant sound
stopped her. She located it as coming from under
a rock only a few feet away, and a little gleam
of satisfaction in her sombre eyes showed that she
had found that for which she searched. The angry
rattlesnake was coiled to strike, but she approached
without hesitancy. Calculating how far
it could throw itself, she stood a little beyond its
range and for a moment stood watching the glitter
of its wicked little eyes, the lightning-like action
of its tongue. When she moved, its head followed
her, but she dexterously pinned it to the rock with
her forked stick and placed the heel of her moccasin
upon its writhing body. Then, stooping, she
severed its head from its body with her knife.</p>
<p>She put the head in a square of cloth and continued
her search. After a time, she found another,
and when she went down the hill there were three
heads in the blood-soaked square of cloth. She
hid them in the willows, and went into the house
to stir the contents of the tin cup. She noted
with evident satisfaction that it had thickened somewhat.
Little Coyote&#8217;s woman had told her it would
do so. She found a bottle which had contained
lemon extract, and this she rinsed. She measured
a teaspoonful of the thick, reddish-brown liquid
and poured it into the bottle, filling it afterward
with water. The cup she took with her into the
willows. Laying the heads of the snakes upon a
flat stone, she cut them through the jaws, and,
extracting the poison sac, stirred the fluid into the
tin cup. While she stirred, she remembered that
she had heard an owl hoot the night before. It
was an ill-omen, and it had sounded close. The
hooting of an owl meant harm to some one. She
wondered now if an owl feather would not make
the medicine stronger. She set down her cup and
looked carefully under the trees, but could find no
feathers. Ah, well, it was stout enough medicine
without it!</p>
<p>She had brought a long, keen-bladed hunting-knife
into the willows, and she dipped the point
of it into the concoction&mdash;blowing upon it until it
dried, then repeating the process. When the point
of the blade was well discolored, she muttered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s de strong medicine!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes glittered like the eyes of the snakes
among the rocks, and they seemed smaller. Their
roundness and the liquid softness of them was gone.
She looked &#8220;pure Injun,&#8221; as Smith would have
phrased it, with murder in her heart. Deliberately,
malevolently, she spat upon the earth beneath which
the letter lay, before she returned to the house.</p>
<p>She heard Susie&#8217;s voice in the Schoolmarm&#8217;s
room, and quickly hid the knife behind a mirror
in the living-room, where she hid everything which
she wished to conceal, imagining, for some unknown
reason, that no one but herself would ever think
of looking there. Susie often had thought laughingly
that it looked like a pack-rat&#8217;s nest.</p>
<p>The woman poured the liquid which remained
in the tin cup into another bottle, frowning when
she spilled a few precious drops upon her hand.
This bottle she also hid behind the mirror.</p>
<p>In Dora Marshall&#8217;s room, Susie was examining
the teacher&#8217;s toilette articles, which held an unfailing
interest for her. She meant to have an exact
duplicate of the manicure set and of the hairbrush
with the heavy silver back. To Susie, these
things, along with side-combs and petticoats that
rustled, were symbols of that elegance which she
longed to attain.</p>
<p>As she stood by the bureau, fumbling with the
various articles, she caught sight of a box through
the crack of the half-open drawer. She had seen
that battered box before. It was the grasshopper
box&mdash;for there was the slit in the top.</p>
<p>Susie was not widely experienced in matters of
sentiment, but she had her feminine intuitions, besides
remarkably well-developed reasoning powers
for her years.</p>
<p>Why, she asked herself as she continued to stare
through the crack, why should Teacher be cherishing
that old bait-box? Why should she have it
there among her handkerchiefs and smelly silk
things, and the soft lace things she wore at her
throat? Why&mdash;unless she attached value to it?
Why&mdash;unless it was a romantic and sacred keepsake?</p>
<p>Susie rather prided herself on being in touch
with all that went on, and now she had an uneasy
feeling that she might have missed something. She
remembered the day of their fishing trip well, and
at the time had thought she had scented a budding
romance. Had they quarrelled, she wondered?</p>
<p>She sat on the edge of the bed and swung her
feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, but won&#8217;t it seem lonesome here without
Mr. Ralston?&#8221; Susie sighed deeply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he going away?&#8221; Dora asked quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be goin&#8217; pretty soon now, because he&#8217;s
found most of his strays and bought all the ponies
he wants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose he will be glad to get back among
his friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie thought Teacher looked a little pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;ll go back and get married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he say so?&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie was <i>sure</i> she was paler.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she replied nonchalantly. &#8220;I just
thought so, because anybody that&#8217;s as good-looking
as he is, gets gobbled up quick. Don&#8217;t you think
he is good-looking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he does very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee whiz, I wish he&#8217;d ask me to marry him!&#8221;
said Susie unblushingly. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t see me
for dust, the way I&#8217;d travel. But there&#8217;s no
danger. Look at them there skinny arms!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Susie! What grammar!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those there skinny arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those skinny arms; those hair; those eyes&mdash;soft
and gentle like a couple of augers, Meeteetse
says.&#8221; Susie shook her head in mock despondency.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to be beautiful, too. Once I cut a
piece out of a newspaper that told how you could
get rosy cheeks. It gave all the different things
to put in, so I sent off and got &#8217;em. I mixed &#8217;em
like it said and rubbed it on my face. There
wasn&#8217;t any mistake about my rosy cheeks, but you
ought to have seen the blisters on my cheek-bones&mdash;big
as dollars!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you will not be so thin when you
are older,&#8221; Dora said consolingly, &#8220;and your hair
would be a very pretty color if only you would
wear a hat and take a little care of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie shook her head and sighed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it will be too late then, for he will be
snapped up by some of those stylish town girls.
You see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dora put buttons in her shirt-waist sleeves in
silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he liked to stay here until you quarrelled
with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I quarrelled with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; Susie was innocence itself.
&#8220;You treat him so polite, I thought you must have
quarrelled&mdash;such a chilly polite,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think <i>he</i> has observed it,&#8221; Dora answered
coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, he has.&#8221; Susie waited discreetly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you come to the table and say, Good-morning,
and look at him without seeing him, I
know he&#8217;d a lot rather you cuffed him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a dreadful word, Susie, and what an
absurd idea!&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie noted that Teacher&#8217;s eyes brightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You&#8217;ll</i> be goin&#8217; away, too, pretty soon, and I
s&#8217;pose you&#8217;ll be glad you will never see him again.
But,&#8221; she added dolefully, &#8220;ain&#8217;t it awful the way
people just meets and parts?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dora was a long time finding that for which
she was searching among the clothes hanging on a
row of nails, and Susie, rolling her eyes in that
direction, was sure, very sure, that she saw Teacher
dab at her lashes with the frilly ruffle of a petticoat
before she turned around.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did he say he was going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t say; but to-day or to-morrow, I
should think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he cared so much because I am cool to him,
he certainly would have asked me why I treated
him so. But he didn&#8217;t care enough to ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teacher&#8217;s voice sounded queer even to herself,
and she seemed intensely interested in buttoning her
boots.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! I know why. It&#8217;s because he thinks
you like that Smith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Smith!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Smith.&#8221;</p>
<p>The jangle of Ling&#8217;s triangle interrupted the
fascinating conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;How perfectly foolish!&#8221; gasped Dora.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to Smith,&#8221; Susie replied dryly, &#8220;nor to
Mr. Ralston.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie looked at the unoccupied chairs at the
table as she and Dora seated themselves. Ralston&#8217;s,
Tubbs&#8217;s, Smith&#8217;s, and McArthur&#8217;s chairs were
vacant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like you&#8217;re losin&#8217; your boarders fast,
Ling,&#8221; she remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good thing,&#8221; Ling answered candidly.</p>
<p>The Indian woman gulped her coffee, but refused
the food which was passed to her. A strange
faintness, accompanied by nausea, was creeping
upon her. Her vision was blurred, and she saw
Meeteetse Ed, at the opposite end of the table,
as through a fog. She pushed back her chair
and went into the living-room, swaying a little as
she walked. A faint moan caught Susie&#8217;s ear, and
she hastened to her mother.</p>
<p>The woman was lying on the floor by the bench
where she sewed, her head pillowed on her rag-rug.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother! Why, what&#8217;s the matter with your
hand? It&#8217;s swelled!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heap sick, Susie!&#8221; she moaned. &#8220;My arm
aches me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; cried Susie, who had turned back her
sleeve. &#8220;Her arm is black&mdash;a purple black, and
it&#8217;s swellin&#8217; up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I heap sick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you do to your arm, Mother? Did
you have the bandage off?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it come off, and I pin him up,&#8221; said
Ling, who was standing by.</p>
<p>A paroxysm of pain seized the woman, and she
writhed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks exactly like a rattlesnake bite! I saw
a fellow once that was bit in the ankle, and it
swelled up and turned a color like that,&#8221; declared
Susie in horror. &#8220;Mother, you haven&#8217;t been foolin&#8217;
with snakes, or been bit?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I no been bit,&#8221; she groaned, and her eyes had
in them the appealing look of a sick spaniel.</p>
<p>Dora and Susie helped her to her room, and
though they tried every simple remedy of which
they had ever heard, to reduce the rapidly swelling
arm, all seemed equally unavailing. The woman&#8217;s
convulsions hourly became more violent and frequent,
while her arm was frightful to behold&mdash;black,
as it was, from hand to shoulder with coagulated
blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;If only we had an idea of the cause!&#8221; cried
Dora, distracted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, can&#8217;t you imagine anything that
would make your arm bad like this? Try to think.&#8221;</p>
<p>But though drops of perspiration stood on the
woman&#8217;s forehead, and her grip tore the pillow,
she obstinately shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I be better pretty soon,&#8221; was all she would
say, and tried to smile at Susie.</p>
<p>&#8220;If only some one would come!&#8221; Dora went
to the open window often and listened for Ralston&#8217;s
voice or McArthur&#8217;s&mdash;the latter having gone for
his mail.</p>
<p>The strain of watching the woman&#8217;s suffering
told on both of the girls, and the night by her
bedside seemed centuries long. Toward morning
the paroxysms appeared to reach a climax and
then to subside. They were of shorter duration,
and the intervals between were longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s better, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; Dora said hopefully,
but Susie shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so; she&#8217;s worse. There&#8217;s that
look behind, back of her eyes&mdash;that dead look&mdash;can&#8217;t
you see it? And it&#8217;s in her face, too. I
don&#8217;t know how to say what I mean, but it&#8217;s there,
and it makes me shiver like cold.&#8221; The girl looked
in mingled awe and horror at the first human
being she ever had seen die.</p>
<p>Unable to endure the strain any longer, Dora
went into the fresh air, and Susie dropped on her
knees by the bedside and took her mother&#8217;s limp
hand in both of hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother,&#8221; she begged pitifully, &#8220;say
something. Don&#8217;t go away without sayin&#8217; something
to Susie!&#8221;</p>
<p>With an effort of will, the woman slowly opened
her dull eyes and fixed them upon the child&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yas,&#8221; she breathed; &#8220;I <i>want</i> to say something.&#8221;</p>
<p>The words came slowly and thickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I no&mdash;get well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>Unheeding the wail, perhaps not hearing it, she
went on, stopping often between words:</p>
<p>&#8220;I steal&mdash;from you&mdash;my little girl. I bad
woman, Susie. It is right I die. I take de money&mdash;out
of de bank dat MacDonald leave us&mdash;to give
to Smith. De hold-ups steal de money on&mdash;de
road. I have de bad heart&mdash;Susie&mdash;to do dat. I
know now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t talk like that, Mother!&#8221; cried
Susie, gripping her hand convulsively. &#8220;You
thought you&#8217;d get it again and put it back. You
didn&#8217;t mean to steal from me. I know all about
it. And I&#8217;ve got the money. Mr. Ralston found
a check you had thrown away&mdash;you&#8217;d signed your
name on it in the wrong place. When we saw
the date, and what a lot of money it was, and
found you had gone to town, we guessed the rest.
It was easy to see Smith in that. So we held
you up, and got it back. We knew there was
no danger to anybody, but, of course, we felt bad
to worry and frighten you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; said the woman simply. She had
no strength or breath or time to spare. &#8220;Dey&#8217;s
more. I tell you&mdash;I kill Smith&mdash;if he lie. He lie.
He bull-dog white man. I make de strong medicine
to kill him&mdash;and I get de poison in my arm when
de bandage slip. Get de bottles and de knife
behind de lookin&#8217;-glass&mdash;I show you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie quickly did as she was bid.</p>
<p>&#8220;De lemon bottle is de love-charm of de Sioux.
One teaspoonful&mdash;no more, Little Coyote&#8217;s woman
say. De other bottle is de bad medicine. Be
careful. Smith&mdash;make fool&mdash;of me&mdash;Susie.&#8221;
What else she would have said ended in a gurgle.
Her jaw dropped, and she died with her glazing
eyes upon Susie&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>Susie pulled the gay Indian blanket gently over
her mother&#8217;s shoulders, as if afraid she would be
cold. Then she slipped a needle and some beads
and buckskin, to complete an unfinished moccasin,
underneath the blanket. Her mother was going on
a long journey, and would want occupation. There
were no tears in Susie&#8217;s eyes when she replaced the
bottles and the skinning knife with the discolored
blade behind the mirror.</p>
<p>The wan little creature seemed to have no tears
to shed. She was unresponsive to Dora&#8217;s broken
words of sympathy, and the grub-liners&#8217; awkward
condolences&mdash;they seemed not to reach her heart at
all. She heard them without hearing, for her mind
was chaos as she moved silently from room to
room, or huddled, a forlorn figure, on the bench
where her mother always had sat.</p>
<p>Breakfast was long since over and the forenoon
well advanced when she finally left the silent house
and crept like the ghost of her spirited self down
the path to the stable and into the roomy stall
where her stout little cow-pony stood munching
hay.</p>
<p>In her sorrow, the dumb animal was the one
thing to which she turned. He lifted his head
when she went in, and threw his cropped ears
forward, while his eyes grew limpid as a horse&#8217;s
eyes will at the approach of some one it knows
well and looks to for food and affection.</p>
<p>They had almost grown up together, and the
time Susie had spent on his back, or with him in
the corral or stall, formerly had been half her
waking hours. They had no fear of each other;
only deep love and mutual understanding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Croppy! Croppy!&#8221; her childish voice
quavered. &#8220;Oh, Croppy, you&#8217;re all I&#8217;ve got left!&#8221;
She slipped her arms around his thick neck and hid
her face in his mane.</p>
<p>He stopped eating and stood motionless while
she clung to him, his ears alert at the sound of
the familiar voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>shall</i> I do!&#8221; she wailed in an abandonment
of grief.</p>
<p>In her inexperience, it seemed to Susie, that with
her mother&#8217;s death all the world had come to an
end for her. Undemonstrative as they were, and
meagre as had been any spoken words of affection,
the bond of natural love between them had seemed
strong and unbreakable until Smith&#8217;s coming.
They had been all in all to each other in their
unemotional way; and now this unexpected tragedy
seemed to crush the child, because it was something
which never had entered her thoughts. It
was a crisis with which she did not know how to
cope or to bear. The world could never be blacker
for her than it was when she clung sobbing to the
little sorrel pony&#8217;s thick neck that morning. The
future looked utterly cheerless and impossible to endure.
She had not learned that no tragedy is so
blighting that there is not a way out&mdash;a way which
the sufferer makes himself, which comes to him, or
into which he is forced. Nothing stays as it is. But
it appeared to Susie that life could never be different,
except to be worse.</p>
<p>She had talked much to McArthur of the outside
world, and questioned him, and a doubt had
sprung up as to the feasibility of searching for
her kinsfolk, as she had planned. There were
many, many trails and wire fences to bewilder one,
and people&mdash;hundreds of people&mdash;people who were
not always kind. His answers filled her with vague
fears. To be only sixteen, and alone, is cause
enough for tears, and Susie shed them now.</p>
<p>McArthur, with a radiant face, was riding
toward the ranch to which he had become singularly
attached. His saddle-pockets bulged with mail,
and his elbows flapped joyously as he urged his
horse to greater speed. He looked up eagerly at
the house as he crossed the ford, and his kind eyes
shone with happiness when he rode into the stable-yard
and swung out of the saddle.</p>
<p>He heard a sound, the unmistakable sound of
sobbing, as he was unsaddling. Listening, he
knew it came from somewhere in the stable, so he
left his horse and went inside.</p>
<p>It was Susie, as he had thought. She lifted her
tear-stained face from the pony&#8217;s mane when he
spoke, and he knew that she was glad to see him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pardner, I thought you&#8217;d <i>never</i> come!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The mail was late, and I stayed with the
Major to wait for it. What has gone wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother&#8217;s dead,&#8221; she said. &#8220;She was poisoned
accidentally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Susie! And there was no one here?&#8221; The
news seemed incredible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only Teacher and me&mdash;no one that knew what
to do. We sent Meeteetse for a doctor, but he
hasn&#8217;t come yet. He probably got drunk and
forgot what he went for. It&#8217;s been a terrible
night, pardner, and a terrible day!&#8221;</p>
<p>McArthur looked at her with troubled eyes, and
once more he stroked her hair with his gentle,
timid touch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything just looks awful to me, with Dad
and mother both gone, and me here alone on this
big ranch, with only Ling and grub-liners. And
to think of it all the rest of my life like this&mdash;with
nobody that I belong to, or that belongs to
me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Something was recalled to McArthur with a start
by Susie&#8217;s words. He had forgotten!</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Susie, come with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She followed him outside, where he unbuckled
his saddle-pocket and took a daguerreotype from
a wooden box which had come in the mail. The
gilt frame was tarnished, the purple velvet lining
faded, and when he handed the case to Susie she
had to hold it slanting in the light to see the
picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad!&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at McArthur with eyes wide in
wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Donald MacDonald, my aunt Harriet&#8217;s brother,
who went north to buy furs for the Hudson Bay
Company!&#8221; McArthur&#8217;s eyes were smiling
through the moisture in them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got one just like it!&#8221; Susie cried,
still half unable to believe her eyes and ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sure that day you mimicked your father
when he said, &#8216;Never forget you are a MacDonald!&#8217;
for I have heard my aunt say that a
thousand times, and in just that way. But I
wanted to be surer before I said anything to you,
so I sent for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pardner!&#8221; and with a sudden impulse
which was neither Scotch nor Indian, but entirely
of herself, Susie threw her arms about his neck
and all but choked him in the only hug which
Peter McArthur, A.M., Ph.D., could remember ever
having had.</p>

<h3>THE MURDERER OF WHITE ANTELOPE</h3>
</div>

<p>It was nearly dusk, and Ralston was only a few
hundred yards from the Bar C gate, when he met
Babe, highly perfumed and with his hair suspiciously
slick, coming out. Babe&#8217;s look of disappointment
upon seeing him was not flattering, but
Ralston ignored it in his own delight at the meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was your rush? I was just goin&#8217; over
to see you,&#8221; was Babe&#8217;s glum greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m here to see you,&#8221; Ralston returned,
&#8220;but I forgot to perfume myself and tallow my
hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw-w-w,&#8221; rumbled Babe, sheepishly. &#8220;What&#8217;d
you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what I&#8217;m in the country for?&#8221;</p>
<p>Babe nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve located my man, and he&#8217;s going to drive
off a big bunch to-night. There&#8217;s two of them
in fact, and I&#8217;ll need help. Are you game for
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mamma!&#8221; Babe rolled his eyes in ecstasy.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has a horror of doing time,&#8221; Ralston went
on, &#8220;and if he has any show at all, he&#8217;s going
to put up a hard fight. I&#8217;d like the satisfaction of
bringing them both in, single-handed, but it isn&#8217;t
fair to the Colonel to take any chances of their
getting away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Smith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That bastard with his teeth stickin&#8217; out?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralston laughed assent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pickin&#8217;s!&#8221; cried Babe, with gusto. &#8220;I&#8217;d like
to kill that feller every mornin&#8217; before breakfast.
Will I go? Will I? <i>Will</i> I?&#8221; Babe&#8217;s crescendo
ended in a joyous whoop of exultation. &#8220;Wait
till I ride back and tell the Colonel, and git my
ca&#8217;tridge belt. I take it off of an evenin&#8217; these
tranquil times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralston turned his horse and started back, so
engrossed in thoughts of the work ahead of him
that it was not until Babe overtook him that he
remembered he had forgotten to ask Babe&#8217;s business
with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess the old Colonel was tickled
when he heard you&#8217;d spotted the rustlers,&#8221; said
Babe, as he reined in beside him. &#8220;He wanted to
come along&mdash;did for a fact, and him nearly seventy.
He&#8217;d push the lid off his coffin and climb out at
his own funeral if somebody&#8217;d happen to mention
that thieves was brandin&#8217; his calves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said you had started to the ranch to see
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;I forgot. Your father sent word to
the Colonel that he was sellin&#8217; off his cattle and
goin&#8217; into sheep, and wanted the Colonel to let
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The poor old Governor! It&#8217;ll about break his
heart, I know; and I should be there. At his
time of life it&#8217;s a pretty hard and galling thing
to quit cattle&mdash;to be forced out of the business
into sheep. It&#8217;s like bein&#8217; made to change your
politics or religion against your will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Fore I&#8217;d wrangle woolers,&#8221; declared Babe,
&#8220;I&#8217;d hold up trains or rob dudes or do &#8217;most
any old thing. Say, I&#8217;ve rid by sheep-wagons when
I was durn near starvin&#8217; ruther than eat with a
sheep-herder or owe one a favor. Where do you
find a man like the Colonel in sheep?&#8221; demanded
Babe. &#8220;You don&#8217;t find &#8217;em. Nothin&#8217; but a lot
of upstart sheep-herders, that&#8217;s got rich in five
years and don&#8217;t know how to act.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re prejudiced, Babe. Not all sheepmen
are muckers any more than all cattlemen are
gentlemen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not prejudiced a-<i>tall</i>!&#8221; declared Babe excitedly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m perfectly fair and square. Woolers is
demoralizin&#8217;. Associate with woolers, and it takes
the spirit out of a feller quicker&#8217;n cookin.&#8217; In
five years you won&#8217;t be half the man you are now
if you go into sheep. I&#8217;ll sure hate to see it!&#8221;
His voice was all but pathetic as he contemplated
Ralston&#8217;s downfall.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you will, though, Babe, if I get out
of this with a whole hide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be so well fixed you can git married
then?&#8221; There was some constraint in Babe&#8217;s tone,
which he meant to be casual.</p>
<p>Ralston&#8217;s heart gave him a twinge of pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;ve had every chance to git
acquainted with the Schoolmarm,&#8221; he observed,
since Ralston did not reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t like me, Babe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>What</i>!&#8221; yelled Babe, screwing up his face in
a grimace of surprise and unbelief.</p>
<p>&#8220;She would rather talk to Ling than to me&mdash;at
least, she seems far more friendly to any one
else than to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, she must be loony not to like you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralston could not help laughing outright at
Babe&#8217;s vigorous loyalty.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not necessarily a sign of insanity to dislike
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t go that far, does she?&#8221; demanded
Babe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t care a-tall, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Ralston replied quietly; &#8220;I care a
great deal. It hurts me more than I ever was
hurt before; because, you see, Babe, I never loved
a woman before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw-w-w,&#8221; replied Babe, in deepest sympathy.</p>
<p>Smith had congratulated himself often during
the day upon the fact that he could not have
chosen a more propitious time for the execution
of his plans&mdash;at least, so far as the Bar C outfit
was concerned. His uneasiness passed as the protecting
darkness fell without their having seen a
single person the entire day.</p>
<p>When the last glimmer of daylight had faded,
Tubbs and Smith started on the drive, heading the
cattle direct for their destination. They were
fatter than Smith had supposed, so they could not
travel as rapidly as he had calculated, but he and
Tubbs pushed them along as fast as they could
without overheating them.</p>
<p>The darkness, which gave Smith courage, made
Tubbs nervous. He swore at the cattle, he swore
at his horse, he swore at the rocks over which his
horse stumbled; and he constantly strained his roving
eyes to penetrate the darkness for pursuers.
Every gulch and gully held for him a fresh terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! I wisht I was out of this onct!&#8221; burst
from him when the howl of a wolf set his nerves
jangling.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d you say?&#8221; Smith stopped in the
middle of a song he was singing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said I wisht I was down where the monkeys
are throwin&#8217; nuts! I&#8217;m chilly,&#8221; declared Tubbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chilly? It&#8217;s hot!&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith was light-hearted, sanguine. He told himself
that perhaps it was as well, after all, that
the hold-ups had got off with the &#8220;old woman&#8217;s&#8221;
money. She might have made trouble when she
found that he meant to go or had gone with Dora.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t tell about women,&#8221; Smith said to
himself. &#8220;They&#8217;re like ducks: no two fly alike.&#8221;</p>
<p>He felt secure, yet from force of habit his hand
frequently sought his cartridge-belt, his rifle in
its scabbard, his six-shooter in the holster under
his arm. And while he serenely hummed the songs
of the dance-halls and round-up camps, two silent
figures, so close that they heard the clacking of
the cattle&#8217;s split hoofs, Tubbs&#8217;s vacuous oaths,
Smith&#8217;s contented voice, were following with the
business-like persistency of the law.</p>
<p>The four mounted men rode all night, speaking
seldom, each thinking his own thoughts, dreaming
his own dreams. Not until the faintest light
grayed the east did the pursuers fall behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not more&#8217;n a mile to water now&#8221;&mdash;Smith
had made sure of his country this time&mdash;&#8220;and
we&#8217;ll hold the cattle in the brush and take
turns watchin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a go with me,&#8221; answered Tubbs, yawning
until his jaws cracked. &#8220;I&#8217;m asleep now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ralston and Babe knew that Smith would camp
for several hours in the creek-bottom, so they
dropped into a gulch and waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll picket their horses first, then one of
them will keep watch while the other sleeps. Very
likely Tubbs will be the first guard, and, unless
I&#8217;m mistaken, Tubbs will be dead to the world in
fifteen minutes&mdash;though, maybe, he&#8217;s too scared to
sleep.&#8221; Ralston&#8217;s surmise proved to be correct
in every particular.</p>
<p>After they had picketed their horses, Smith told
Tubbs to keep watch for a couple of hours, while
he slept.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we jest switch that programme
around?&#8221; inquired Tubbs plaintively. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
hardly keep my eyes open.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do as I tell you,&#8221; Smith returned sharply.</p>
<p>Tubbs eyed him with envy as he spread down
his own and Tubbs&#8217;s saddle-blankets.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t what you&#8217;d call &#8216;crazy with the heat.&#8217;&#8221;
Tubbs shivered. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t I crawl under one of
them blankets with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet you can&#8217;t. I&#8217;d jest as lief sleep with
a bull-snake as a man,&#8221; snorted Smith in disgust,
and, pulling the blankets about his ears, was lost
in oblivion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I kin look back upon times when I&#8217;ve enj&#8217;yed
myself more,&#8221; muttered Tubbs disconsolately, as
he paced to and fro, or at intervals climbed wearily
out of the creek-bottom to look and listen.</p>
<p>Ralston and Babe had concealed themselves behind
a cut-bank which in the rainy season was a
tributary of the creek. They were waiting for
daylight, and for the guard to grow sleepy and
careless. With little more emotion than hunters
waiting in a blind for the birds to go over, the
two men examined their rifles and six-shooters.
They talked in undertones, laughing a little at
some droll observation or reminiscence. Only by a
sparkle of deviltry in Babe&#8217;s blue eyes, and an
added gravity of expression upon Ralston&#8217;s face,
at moments, would the closest observer have known
that anything unusual was about to take place.
Yet each realized to the fullest extent the possible
dangers ahead of them. Smith, they knew to be
resourceful, he would be desperate, and Tubbs, ignorant
and weak of will as he was, might be
frightened into a kind of frenzied courage. The
best laid plans did not always work out according
to schedule, and if by any chance they were discovered,
and the thieves reached their guns, the
odds were equal. But it was not their way to talk
of danger to themselves. That there was danger
was a fact, too obvious to discuss, but that it was
no hindrance to the carrying out of their plans
was also accepted as being too evident to waste
words upon.</p>
<p>While the east grew pink, they talked of mutual
acquaintances, of horses they had owned, of guns
and big game, of dinners they had eaten, of socks
and saddle blankets that had been stolen from
them in cow outfits&mdash;the important and trivial
were of like interest to these old friends waiting for
what, as each well knew, might be their last sunrise.</p>
<p>Ralston finally crawled to the top of the cut-bank
and looked cautiously about.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time,&#8221; he said briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Bueno</i>.&#8221; Babe gave an extra twitch to the
silk handkerchief knotted about his neck, which,
with him, signified a readiness for action.</p>
<p>He joined Ralston at the top of the cut-bank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a sign!&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Looks like you
and me owned the world, Dick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll lead the horses a little closer, in case we
need them quick. Then, we&#8217;ll keep that bunch of
brush between us and them, till we get close enough.
You take Tubbs, and I&#8217;ll cover Smith&mdash;I want that
satisfaction,&#8221; he added grimly.</p>
<p>It was a typical desert morning, redolent with
sage, which the night&#8217;s dew brought out strongly.
The pink light changing rapidly to crimson was
seeking out the draws and coulees where the purple
shadows of night still lay. The only sound was
the cry of the mourning doves, answering each
other&#8217;s plaintive calls. And across the panorama
of yellow sand, green sage-brush, burning cactus
flowers, distant peaks of purple, all bathed alike
in the gorgeous crimson light of morning, two
dark figures crept with the stealthiness of Indians.</p>
<p>From behind the bush which had been their objective-point
they could hear and see the cattle
moving in the brush below; then a horse on picket
snorted, and as they slid quietly down the bank
they heard a sound which made Babe snicker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that a cow chokin&#8217; to death,&#8221; he whispered,
&#8220;or one of them cherubs merely sleepin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>In sight of the prone figures, they halted.</p>
<p>Smith, with his hat on, his head pillowed on his
saddle, was rolled in an old army blanket; while
Tubbs, from a sitting position against a tree, had
fallen over on the ground with his knees drawn
to his chin. His mouth, from which frightful
sounds of strangulation were issuing, was wide
open, and he showed a little of the whites of his
eyes as he slumbered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t he a dream?&#8221; breathed Babe in Ralston&#8217;s
ear. &#8220;How I&#8217;d like a picture of that face to keep
in the back of my watch!&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s rifle was under the edge of his blanket,
and his six-shooter in its holster lay by his head;
but Tubbs, with the carelessness of a green hand
and the over-confidence which had succeeded his
nervousness, had leaned his rifle against a tree and
laid his six-shooter and cartridge-belt in a crotch.</p>
<p>Ralston nodded to Babe, and simultaneously they
raised their rifles and viewed the prostrate forms
along the barrels.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put up your hands, men!&#8221;</p>
<p>The quick command, sharp, stern, penetrated the
senses of the men inert in heavy sleep. Instantly
Smith&#8217;s hand was upon his gun. He had reached
for it instinctively even before he sat up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop it!&#8221; There was no mistaking the intention
expressed in Ralston&#8217;s voice, and the gun
fell from Smith&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>The red of Smith&#8217;s skin changed to a curious
yellow, not unlike the yellow of the slicker rolled
on the back of his saddle. Panic-stricken for the
moment, he grinned, almost foolishly; then his
hands shot above his head.</p>
<p>A line of sunlight dropped into the creek-bottom,
and a ray was caught by the deputy&#8217;s badge
which shone on Ralston&#8217;s breast. The glitter of
it seemed to fascinate Smith.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8221;&mdash;he drawled a vile name. &#8220;I orter
have known!&#8221;</p>
<p>Still dazed with sleep, and not yet comprehending
anything beyond the fact that he had been
advised to put up his hands, and that a stranger
had drawn an uncommonly fine bead on the head
which he was in honor bound to preserve from
mutilation, Tubbs blinked at Babe and inquired
peevishly:</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; He had forgotten
that he was a thief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shove up your hands!&#8221; yelled Babe.</p>
<p>With an expression of annoyance, Tubbs did as
he was bid, but dropped them again upon seeing
Ralston.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hello!&#8221; he called cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put them hands back!&#8221; Babe waved his rifle-barrel
significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, feller?&#8221; inquired
Tubbs crossly. Though he now recollected the
circumstances under which they were found,
Ralston&#8217;s presence robbed the situation of any
seriousness for him. It did not occur to Tubbs
that any one who knew him could possibly do him
harm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep your hands up, Tubbs,&#8221; said Ralston
curtly, &#8220;and, Babe, take the guns.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for a josh is this anyhow?&#8221;&mdash;in an
aggrieved tone. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t we all friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up, you idjot!&#8221; snapped Smith irritably.
His glance was full of malevolence as Babe took
his guns. The yellow of his skin was now the only
sign by which he betrayed his feelings. To all
other appearances, he was himself again&mdash;insolent,
defiant.</p>
<p>When it thoroughly dawned upon Tubbs that
they were cornered and under arrest, he promptly
went to pieces. He thrust his hands so high above
his head that they lifted him to tiptoe, and they
shook as with palsy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stack the guns and get our horses, Babe,&#8221;
said Ralston.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s hard for a stranger to ketch,&#8221; said
Smith surlily. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get him, for I don&#8217;t aim to
walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right; but don&#8217;t make any break, Smith,&#8221;
Ralston warned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a fool,&#8221; Smith answered gruffly.</p>
<p>Ralston&#8217;s face relaxed as Smith sauntered toward
his horse. He was glad that they had been taken
without bloodshed, and, now the prisoners&#8217; guns
had been removed, that possibility was passed.</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s horse was a newly broken bronco, and
he was a wild beggar, as Smith had said; but he
talked to him reassuringly as the horse jumped to
the end of his picket-rope and stood snorting and
trembling in fright, and finally laid his hand upon
his neck and back. The fingers of one hand were
entwined in the horse&#8217;s mane, and suddenly, with
a cat-like spring made possible only by his desperation,
Smith landed on the bronco&#8217;s back.
With a yell of defiance which Ralston and Babe
remembered for many a day, he kicked the animal
in the ribs, and, as it reared in fright, it pulled
loose from the picket-stake. Smith reached for
the trailing rope, and they were gone!</p>
<p>Ralston shot to cripple the horse, but almost
with the flash they were around the bend of the
creek and out of sight. The breathless, speechless
seconds seemed minutes long before he heard
Babe coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw-w-w!&#8221; roared that person in consternation
and chagrin, as he literally dragged the horses
behind him.</p>
<p>Ralston ran to meet him, and a glance of understanding
passed between them as he leaped into
the saddle and swept around the bend like a whirlwind,
less than thirty seconds behind Smith.</p>
<p>Babe knew that he must secure Tubbs before he
joined in the pursuit, and he was pulling the rawhide
riata from his saddle when Tubbs, inspired
by Smith&#8217;s example and imbued with the hysterical
courage which sometimes comes to men of his type
in desperate straits, made a dash for his rifle, and
reached it. He threw it to his shoulder, but, quick
as he was, Babe was quicker.</p>

SMITH REACHED FOR THE TRAILING ROPE AND THEY WERE GONE!<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>With the lightning-like gesture which had made
his name a byword where Babe himself was unknown,
he pulled his six-shooter from its holster
and shot Tubbs through the head. He fell his
length, like a bundle of blankets, and, even as he
dropped, Babe was in the saddle and away.</p>
<p>It was a desperate race that was on, between
desperate men; for if Smith was desperate, Ralston
was not less so. Every fibre of his being was
concentrated in the determination to recapture the
man who had twice outwitted him. The deputy
sheriff&#8217;s reputation was at stake; his pride and
self-respect as well; and the blood-thirst was rising
in him with each jump of his horse. Every other
emotion paled, every other interest faded, beside
the intensity of his desire to stop the man ahead of
him.</p>
<p>Smith knew that he had only a chance in a
thousand. He had seen Ralston with a six-shooter
explode a cartridge placed on a rock as far away
as he could see it, and he was riding the little
brown mare whose swiftness Smith had reason to
remember.</p>
<p>But he had the start, his bronco was young,
its wind of the best, and it might have speed.
The country was rough, Ralston&#8217;s horse might fall
with him. So long as Smith was at liberty there
was a fighting chance, and as always, he took it.</p>
<p>The young horse, mad with fright, kept to the
serpentine course of the creek-bottom, and Ralston,
on the little mare, sure-footed and swift as a jack-rabbit,
followed its lead.</p>
<p>The race was like a steeple-chase, with boulders
and brush and fallen logs to be hurdled, and
gullies and washouts to complicate the course. And
at every outward curve the <i>pin-n-gg!</i> of a bullet
told Smith of his pursuer&#8217;s nearness. Lying flat
on the barebacked horse, he hung well to the side
until he was again out of sight. The lead plowed
up the dirt ahead of him and behind him, and
flattened itself against rocks; and at each futile
shot Smith looked over his shoulder and grinned
in derision, though his skin had still the curious
yellowness of fear.</p>
<p>The race was lasting longer than Smith had
dared hope. It began to look as if it were to
narrow to a test of endurance, for although
Ralston&#8217;s shots missed by only a hair&#8217;s breadth at
times, still, they missed. If Smith ever had prayed,
he would have prayed then; but he had neither
words nor faith, so he only hoped and rode.</p>
<p>A flat came into sight ahead and a yell burst
from Ralston&mdash;a yell that was unexpected to himself.
A wave of exultation which seemed to come
from without swept over him. He touched the
mare with the spur, and she skimmed the rocks as
if his weight on her back were nothing. It was
smoother, and he was close enough now to use his
best weapon. He thrust the empty rifle into its
scabbard, and shot at Smith&#8217;s horse with his six-shooter.
It stumbled; then its knees doubled under
it, and Smith turned in the air. The game was
up; Smith was afoot.</p>
<p>He picked up his hat and dusted his coat-sleeve
while he waited, and his face was yellow and evil.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a dum good horse,&#8221; was Babe&#8217;s
single comment as he rode up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get back to camp!&#8221; said Ralston peremptorily,
and Smith, in his high-heeled, narrow-soled boots,
stumbled ahead of them without a word.</p>
<p>He looked at Tubbs&#8217;s body without surprise.
Sullen and surly, he felt no regret that Tubbs,
braggart and fool though he was, was dead. Smith
had no conscience to remind him that he himself
was responsible.</p>
<p>Babe shook out Smith&#8217;s blue army blanket and
rolled Tubbs in it. Smith had bought it from a
drunken soldier, and he had owned it a long time.
It was light and almost water-proof; he liked it,
and he eyed Babe&#8217;s action with disfavor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon this gent will have to spend the day
in a tree,&#8221; said Babe prosaically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you use no other blanket nor that?&#8221;
demanded Smith.</p>
<p>It was the first time he had spoken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take on so,&#8221; Babe replied comfortingly.
&#8220;They furnish blankets where you&#8217;re goin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on with his work of throwing a hitch
around Tubbs with his picket-rope.</p>
<p>Ralston divided the scanty rations which Smith
and Tubbs, and he and Babe, had brought with
them. He made coffee, and handed a cup to Smith
first. The latter arose and changed his seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never could eat with a corp&#8217; settin&#8217; around,&#8221;
he said disagreeably.</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s fastidiousness made Babe&#8217;s jaw drop,
and a piece of biscuit which had made his cheek
bulge inadvertently rolled out, but was skillfully
intercepted before it reached the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll excuse us, Mr. Smith,&#8221; said Babe,
bowing as well as he could sitting cross-legged
on the ground. &#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll overlook our forgittin&#8217;
the napkins and toothpicks.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they had finished, they slung Tubbs&#8217;s
body into a tree, beyond the reach of coyotes.
The cattle they left to drift back to their range.
Tubbs&#8217;s horse was saddled for Smith, and, with
Ralston holding the lead rope and Babe in the
rear, the procession started back to the ranch.</p>
<p>Smith had much time to think on the homeward
ride. He based his hopes upon the Indian woman.
He knew that he could conciliate her with a look.
She was resourceful, she had unlimited influence
with the Indians, and she had proven that she was
careless of her own life where he was concerned.
She was a powerful ally. The situation was not
so bad as it had seemed. He had been in tighter
places, he told himself, and his spirits rose as he
rode. Without the plodding cattle, they retraced
their steps in half the time it had taken them to
come, and it was not much after midday when
they were sighted from the MacDonald ranch.</p>
<p>The Indians that Smith had missed were at the
ford to meet them: Bear Chief, Yellow Bird, Running
Rabbit, and others, who were strangers to
him. They followed as Ralston and Babe rode
with their prisoner up the path to put him under
guard in the bunk-house.</p>
<p>Susie, McArthur, and Dora were at the door
of the ranch-house, and Susie stepped out and
stopped them when they would have passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t take him there; that place is
for our <i>friends</i>. There&#8217;s the harness-house below.
The dogs sleep there. There&#8217;ll be room for one
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>The insult stung Smith to the quick.</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>you</i> got to say about it? Where&#8217;s your
mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>With narrowed eyes she looked for a moment
into his ugly visage, then she laid her hand upon
the rope and led his horse close to the open
window of the bedroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; and she pointed to the still figure on
its improvised bier. &#8220;There&#8217;s my mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith looked in silence, and once more showed
by his yellowing skin the fear within him. The
avenue of escape upon which he had counted almost
with certainty, was closed to him. At that moment
the harsh, high walls of the penitentiary loomed
close; the doors looked wide open to receive him;
but, after an instant&#8217;s hesitation, he only shrugged
his shoulders and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell! I sleeps good anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>In deference to Susie&#8217;s wishes, Ralston and Babe
had swung their horses to go back down the path
when Smith turned in his saddle and looked at
Dora. She was regarding him sorrowfully, her
eyes misty with disappointment in him; and Smith
misunderstood. A rush of feeling swept over him,
and he burst out impulsively:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go back on me! I done it for you, girl!
I done it to make <i>our stake</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dora stood speechless, bewildered, confused
under the astonished eyes upon her. She was appalled
by the light in which he had placed her; and
while the others followed to the harness-house below,
she sank limply upon the door-sill, her face
in her hands.</p>
<p>Smith sat on a wagon-tongue, swinging his legs,
while they cleaned out the harness-house a bit for
his occupancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Throw down some straw and rustle up a
blanket or two,&#8221; said Babe; and McArthur pulled
his saddle-blankets apart to contribute the cleanest
toward Smith&#8217;s bed.</p>
<p>Something in the alacrity the &#8220;bug-hunter&#8221;
displayed angered Smith. He always had despised
the little man in a general way. He uncinched his
saddle on the wrong side; he clucked at his horse;
he removed his hat when he talked to women; he
was a weak and innocent fool to Smith, who lost
no occasion to belittle him. Now, when the
prisoner saw him moving about, free to go and
come as he pleased, while he, Smith, was tied like
an unruly pup, it, of a sudden, made his gorge
rise; and, with one of his swift, characteristic
transitions of mood, Smith turned to the Indians
who guarded him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never could find out who killed White
Antelope&mdash;you smart-Alec Injuns!&#8221; he sneered
contemptuously. &#8220;And you&#8217;ve always wanted to
know, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221; He eyed them one by one.
&#8220;Why, you don&#8217;t know straight up, you women
warriors! I&#8217;ve a notion to tell you who killed
White Antelope&mdash;just for fun&mdash;just because I
want to laugh, me&mdash;Smith!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indians drew closer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think you&#8217;re scouts,&#8221; he went on tauntingly,
&#8220;and you never saw White Antelope&#8217;s
blanket right under your nose! Put it back, feller&#8221;&mdash;he
nodded at McArthur. &#8220;I don&#8217;t aim to sleep
on dead men&#8217;s clothes!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indians looked at the blanket, and at
McArthur, whom they had grown to like and
trust. They recognized it now, and in the corner
they saw the stiff and dingy stain, the jagged tell-tale
holes.</p>
<p>McArthur mechanically held it up to view. He
had not the faintest recollection where it had been
purchased, or of whom obtained. Tubbs always
had attended to such things.</p>
<p>No one spoke in the grave silence, and Smith
leered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I likes company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m sociable inclined.
Put him in the dog-house with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie had listened with the Indians; she had
looked at the blanket, the stain, the holes; she
saw the blank consternation in McArthur&#8217;s face,
the gathering storm in the Indians&#8217; eyes. She
stepped out a little from the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mister <i>Smith</i>!&#8221; she said. &#8220;<i>Mister</i> Smith&#8221;&mdash;with
oily, sarcastic emphasis&mdash;&#8220;how did you know
that was White Antelope&#8217;s blanket, when you never
<i>saw</i> White Antelope?&#8221;</p>

<h3>A MONGOLIAN CUPID</h3>
</div>

<p>With his hands thrust deep in his trousers
pockets, Ralston leaned against the corner of the
bunk-house, from which point of vantage he could
catch a glimpse of the Schoolmarm&#8217;s white-curtained
window. He now had no feeling of elation
over his success. Smith was a victorious captive.
Ralston&#8217;s heart ached miserably, and he wished
that the day was ended and the morning come,
that he might go, never to return.</p>
<p>He too had seen the mist in Dora&#8217;s eyes; and,
with Smith&#8217;s words, the air-castles which had persistently
built themselves without volition on his
part, crumbled. There was nothing for him to
do but to efface himself as quickly and as completely
as possible. The sight of him could only
be painful to Dora, and he wished to spare her all
of that within his power.</p>
<p>He looked at the foothills, the red butte rising
in their midst, the tinted Bad Lands, the winding,
willow-fringed creek. It was all beautiful in its
bizarre colorings; but the spirit of the picture,
the warm, glowing heart of it, had gone from it
for him. The world looked a dull and lifeless
place. His love for Dora was greater than he had
known, far mightier than he had realized until the
end, the positive end, had come.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dora!&#8221; he whispered in utter wretchedness.
&#8220;Dear little Schoolmarm!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the room behind the white-curtained window
the Schoolmarm walked the floor with her cheeks
aflame and as close to hysteria as ever she had
been in her life.</p>
<p>&#8220;What <i>will</i> he think of me!&#8221; she asked herself
over and over again, clasping and unclasping her
cold hands. &#8220;What <i>can</i> he think but one thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>The more overwrought she became, the worse the
situation seemed.</p>
<p>&#8220;And how he looked at me! How they all
looked at me! Oh, it was too dreadful!&#8221;</p>
<p>She covered her burning face with her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t the slightest doubt,&#8221; she went on,
&#8220;but that he thinks I knew all about it. Perhaps&#8221;&mdash;she
paused in front of the mirror and stared into
her own horrified eyes&mdash;&#8220;perhaps he thinks I belong
to a gang of robbers! Maybe he thinks I
am Smith&#8217;s tool, or that Smith is my tool, or
something like that! Oh, whatever made him say
such a thing! &#8216;Our stake&mdash;<i>our</i> stake&#8217;&mdash;and&mdash;&#8216;I
done it for you!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Another thought, still more terrifying occurred
to her excited mind:</p>
<p>&#8220;What if he should have to arrest me as an
accomplice!&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat down weakly on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; and she rocked to and fro in misery,
&#8220;if only I never had tried to improve Smith&#8217;s
mind!&#8221;</p>
<p>The tears slipped from under the Schoolmarm&#8217;s
lashes, and her chin quivered.</p>
<p>Worn out by the all night&#8217;s vigil at her mother&#8217;s
bedside, and the exciting events of the morning,
Susie finally succumbed to the strain and slept the
sleep of exhaustion. It was almost supper-time
when she awakened. Passing the Schoolmarm&#8217;s
door, she heard a sound at which she stopped and
frankly listened. Teacher was crying!</p>
<p>&#8220;Ling, this is an awful world. Everything
seems to be upside down and inside out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty tlouble,&#8221; agreed Ling, stepping briskly
about as he collected ingredients for his biscuits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t seem to make much difference whether
you love people or hate &#8217;em; it all ends the same
way&mdash;in tears.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plitty bad thing&mdash;love.&#8221; Ling solemnly measured
baking-powder. &#8220;Make people cly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie surmised correctly that Ling&#8217;s ears also
had been close to a nearby keyhole.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; been fewer tears on this ranch if
it hadn&#8217;t been for Smith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Many devils&mdash;Smith.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie sat on the corner of his work-table, and
there was silence while he deftly mixed, rolled,
and cut his dough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Ralston intends to go away in the morning,&#8221;
said Susie, as the biscuits were slammed in
the oven.</p>
<p>Ling wagged his head dolorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they&#8217;ll never see each other again.&#8221;</p>
<p>His head continued to wag.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ling,&#8221; Susie whispered, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got to <i>do</i>
something.&#8221; She stepped lightly to the open door
and closed it.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>There were few at the supper-table that night,
and there was none of the noisy banter which
usually prevailed. The grub-liners came in softly
and spoke in hushed tones, out of a kind of respect
for two empty chairs which had been the recognized
seats of Tubbs and the Indian woman.</p>
<p>Ralston bowed gravely as Dora entered&mdash;pale,
her eyes showing traces of recent tears. Susie
was absent, having no heart for food or company,
and preferring to sit beside her mother for the
brief time which remained to her. Even Meeteetse
Ed shared in the general depression, and therefore
it was in no spirit of flippancy that he observed
as he replaced his cup violently in its saucer:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh A&#8217;mighty, Ling, you must have biled a
gum-boot in this here tea!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dora, who had drank nearly half of hers, was
unable to account for the peculiar tang which
destroyed its flavor, and Ralston eyed the contents
of his cup doubtfully after each swallow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like as not the water&#8217;s gittin&#8217; alkali,&#8221; ventured
Old Man Rulison.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alkali nothin&#8217;. That&#8217;s gum-boot, or else a
plug of Battle Ax fell in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ling bore Meeteetse&#8217;s criticisms with surprising
equanimity.</p>
<p>A moment later the lights blurred for Dora.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I feel faint,&#8221; she whispered, striving to
rise.</p>
<p>Ralston, who had already noted her increasing
pallor, hastened around the table and helped her
into the air. Ling&#8217;s immobile face was a study
as he saw them leave the room together, but satisfaction
was the most marked of its many expressions.
He watched them from the pantry window
as they walked to the cottonwood log which
served as a garden-seat for all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if it was that queer tea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been a hard day for you,&#8221; Ralston
replied gently.</p>
<p>Dora was silent, and they remained so for some
minutes. Ralston spoke at last and with an effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry&mdash;sorrier than I can tell you&mdash;that
it has been necessary for me to hurt you. I should
rather, far, far rather, hurt myself than you, Miss
Marshall&mdash;I wish I could make you know that.
What I have done has been because it was my
duty. I am employed by men who trust me, and I
was in honor bound to follow the course I have;
but if I had known what I know now&mdash;if I had
been sure&mdash;I might in some way have made it
easier for you. I am going away to-morrow, and
perhaps it will do no harm to tell you that I had
hoped&#8221;&mdash;he stopped to steady his voice, and went
on&mdash;&#8220;I had hoped that our friendship might end
differently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be gone in the morning before you are
awake, so I will say good-night&mdash;and good-by.&#8221;
He arose and put out his hand. &#8220;Shall I send
Susie to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The lump in Dora&#8217;s throat hurt her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; she whispered in a strained
voice. &#8220;I want to say something, too, before you
go. I don&#8217;t want you to go away thinking that
I knew anything of Smith&#8217;s plans; that I knew
he was going to steal cattle; that he was trying
to make a &#8217;stake&#8217; for us&mdash;for <i>me</i>. It is all a
misunderstanding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dora was looking straight ahead of her, and
did not see the change which came over Ralston&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought of Smith in any way except
to help him,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;He seemed different
from most that stopped here, and I thought if
I could just start him right, if only I could show
him what he might do if he tried, he might be
better for my efforts. And, after all, my time and
good intentions were wasted. He deceived me in
making me think that he too wanted to make
more of his life, and that he was trying. And
then to make such a speech before you all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think about it&mdash;or Smith,&#8221; Ralston answered.
&#8220;He has come to his inevitable end.
When there&#8217;s bad blood, mistaken ideals, and wrong
standards of living, you can&#8217;t do much&mdash;you can&#8217;t
do anything. There is only one thing which controls
men of his type, and that is fear&mdash;fear of
the law. His love for you is undoubtedly the best,
the whitest, thing that ever came into his life, but
it couldn&#8217;t keep him straight, and never would.
Don&#8217;t worry. Your efforts haven&#8217;t hurt him, or
you. You are wiser, and maybe he is better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awfully good of you to comfort me,&#8221; said
Dora gratefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good of me?&#8221; he laughed softly. &#8220;Little
Schoolmarm&#8221;&mdash;he laid a hand upon each shoulder
and looked into her eyes&mdash;&#8220;I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her pupils dilated, and she breathed in wonder.</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>love</i> me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221; He brushed back a wisp of hair which
had blown across her cheek, and, stooping, kissed
her deliberately upon the mouth.</p>
<p>Inside the house a radiant Mongolian rushed
from the pantry window into the room where Susie
sat. He carried a nearly empty bottle which had
once contained lemon extract, and his almond eyes
danced as he handed it to her, whispering gleefully:</p>
<p>&#8220;All light! Good medicine!&#8221;</p>
<p>The big kerosene lamp screwed to the wall in
the living-room had long since been lighted, but
Susie still sat on the floor, leaning her cheek against
the blanket which covered the Indian woman. The
house was quiet save for Ling in the kitchen&mdash;and
lonely&mdash;but she had a fancy that her mother would
like to have her there beside her; so, although
she was cramped from sitting, and the house was
close after a hot day, she refused all offers to
relieve her.</p>
<p>She was glad to see McArthur when he tapped
on the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d like to read the letter that
came with the picture,&#8221; he said, as he pulled up
a chair beside her. &#8220;I want you to know how
welcome you will be.&#8221;</p>
<p>He handed her the letter, with its neat, old-fashioned
penmanship, its primness a little tremulous
from the excitement of the writer at the time
she had penned it. Susie read it carefully, and
when she had finished she looked up at him with
softened, grateful eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she good!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The kindest of gentlewomen&mdash;your Aunt
Harriet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My Aunt Harriet!&#8221; Susie said it to herself
rapturously.</p>
<p>&#8220;She hasn&#8217;t much in her life now&mdash;<i>she&#8217;s</i> lonely,
too&mdash;and if you can be spoiled, Susie, you soon
will be well on the way&mdash;between Aunt Harriet
and me.&#8221; He stroked her hair fondly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m to go to school back there and live
with her. I can&#8217;t believe it yet!&#8221; Susie declared.
&#8220;So much has happened in the last twenty-four
hours that I don&#8217;t know what to think about first.
More things have happened in this little time than
in all my life put together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way life seems to be,&#8221; McArthur
said musingly&mdash;&#8220;a few hours at a tension, and
long, dull stretches in between.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does she know&mdash;does Aunt Harriet know&mdash;how
<i>green</i> I am?&#8221;</p>
<p>McArthur laughed at her anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure,&#8221; he replied reassuringly, &#8220;that she
isn&#8217;t expecting a young lady of fashion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve got clothes,&#8221; said Susie. &#8220;Mother
made me a dress that will be just the thing to wear
in that&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;train. She made it
out of two shawls that she bought at the Agency.&#8221;</p>
<p>McArthur looked startled at the frock of red,
green, and black plaids which Susie took from a
nail behind the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;The colors seem a little&mdash;a little&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that black was yellow, it <i>would</i> look better,&#8221;
Susie admitted. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a new Stetson, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will take some little time to arrange your
affairs out here, and in the meantime I&#8217;ll write
Aunt Harriet to choose a wardrobe for you and
send it. It will give her the greatest pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I take Croppy and Daisy May?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Daisy May?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The pet badger,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I named her
after a Schoolmarm we had&mdash;she looks so solemn
and important. I can keep her on a chain, and
she needn&#8217;t eat until we get there,&#8221; Susie pleaded.</p>
<p>Trying not to smile at the mental picture of
himself arriving in the staid college town, with
a tawny-skinned child in a red, green, and black
frock, a crop-eared cayuse, and a badger on a
chain, McArthur ventured it as his opinion that
the climate would be detrimental to Daisy May&#8217;s
health.</p>
<p>&#8220;You undoubtedly will prefer to spend your
summers here, and it will be pleasant to have
Croppy and Daisy May home to welcome you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Susie&#8217;s face sobered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I must come back when school is
over. I wouldn&#8217;t feel it was right to go away
for always and leave Dad and Mother here. Besides,
I guess I&#8217;d <i>want</i> to come back; because,
after all, you know, I&#8217;m half Injun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d try and sleep, and let me sit
here,&#8221; urged McArthur kindly.</p>
<p>Susie shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; Ling will stay after awhile, and I&#8217;m not
sleepy or tired now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good-night, little sister.&#8221; He patted her
head, while all the kindliness of his gentle nature
shone from his eyes.</p>

<h3>IN THEIR OWN WAY</h3>
</div>

<p>Through the chinks in the logs, where the
daubing had dropped out, Smith watched the lights
in the ranch-house. He relieved the tedium of the
hours by trying to imagine what was going on
inside, and in each picture Dora was the central
figure. Now, he told himself, she was wiping the
dishes for Ling, and teaching him English, as
she often did; and when she had finished she would
bring her portfolio into the dining-room and write
home the exciting events of the day. He wondered
what had &#8220;ailed&#8221; the Indian woman, that
she should die so suddenly; but it was immaterial,
since she <i>was</i> dead. He knew that Susie would sit
by her mother; probably in the chair with the
cushion of goose-feathers. It was his favorite
chair, though it went over backwards when he
rocked too hard. Ralston&mdash;curse him!&mdash;was sitting
on one of the benches outside the bunk-house, telling
the grub-liners of Smith&#8217;s capture, and the
bug-hunter was making notes of the story in his
journal. But, alas! as is usual with the pictures
one conjures, nothing at all took place as Smith
fancied.</p>
<p>When all the lights, save the one in the living-room,
had gone out, there was nothing to divert
his thoughts. Babe, who was on guard outside,
refused to converse with him, and he finally lay
down, only to toss restlessly upon the blankets.
The night seemed unusually still and the stillness
made him nervous; even the sound of Babe&#8217;s back
rubbing against the door when he shifted his
position was company. Smith&#8217;s uneasiness was unlike
him, and he wondered at it, while unable to
conquer it. It must have been nearly midnight
when, staring into the darkness with sleepless eyes,
he felt, rather than heard, something move outside.
It came from the rear, and Babe was at
the door for only a moment before he had struck
a match on a log to light a cigarette. The sound
was so slight that only a trained ear like Smith&#8217;s
would have detected it.</p>
<p>It had sounded like the scraping of the leg of
an overall against a sage-brush, and yet it was
so trifling, so indistinct, that a field mouse might
have made it. But somehow Smith knew, he was
sure, that something human had caused it; and as
he listened for a recurrence of the sound, the conviction
grew upon him that there was movement and
life outside. He was convinced that something was
going to happen.</p>
<p>His judgment told him that the prowlers were
more likely to be enemies than friends&mdash;he was in
the enemies&#8217; country. But, on the other hand,
there was always the chance that unexpected help
had arrived. Smith still believed in his luck. The
grub-liners might come to his rescue, or &#8220;the
boys,&#8221; who had been waiting at the rendezvous,
might have learned in some unexpected way what
had befallen him. Even if they were his enemies,
they would first be obliged to overpower Babe, and,
he told himself, in the &#8220;ruckus&#8221; he might somehow
escape.</p>
<p>But even as he argued the question pro and
con, unable to decide whether or not to warn Babe,
a stifled exclamation and the thud of a heavy body
against the door told him that it had been answered
for him. Wide-eyed, breathless, his nerves at a
tension, his heart pounding in his breast, he interpreted
the sounds which followed as correctly
as if he had been an eye-witness to the scene.</p>
<p>He could hear Babe&#8217;s heels strike the ground as
he kicked and threshed, and the inarticulate epithets
told Smith that his guard was gagged. He
knew, too, that the attack was made by more than
two men, for Babe was a young Hercules in
strength.</p>
<p>Were they friends or foes? Were they Bar C
cowpunchers come to take the law into their own
hands, or were they his hoped-for rescuers? The
suspense sent the perspiration out in beads on
Smith&#8217;s forehead, and he wiped his moist face with
his shirt-sleeve. Then he heard the shoulders
against the door, the heavy breathing, the strain
of muscles, and the creaking timber. It crashed
in, and for a second Smith&#8217;s heart ceased to beat.
He sniffed&mdash;and he knew! He smelled buckskin
and the smoke of tepees. He spoke a word or
two in their own tongue. They laughed softly,
without answering. From instinct, he backed into
a corner, and they groped for him in the darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rat is hiding. Shall we get the cat?&#8221;
The voice was Bear Chief&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Running Rabbit spoke as he struck a match.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out, white man. It is too hot in here
for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith recovered himself, and said as he stepped
forward:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am ready, friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>They tied his hands and pushed him into the
open air. Babe squirmed in impotent rage as he
passed. Dark shadows were gliding in and out of
the stable and corrals, and when they led him to a
saddled horse they motioned him to mount. He
did so, and they tied his feet under the horse&#8217;s
belly, his wrists to the saddle-horn. Seeing the
thickness of the rope, he jested:</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends, I am not an ox.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were,&#8221; Yellow Bird answered, &#8220;there
would be fresh meat to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were other Indians waiting on their horses,
deep in the gloom of the willows, and when the
three whom Smith recognized were in the saddle
they led the way to the creek, and the others fell
in behind. They followed the stream for some distance,
that they might leave no tracks, and there
was no sound but the splashing and floundering of
the horses as they slipped on the moss-covered
rocks of the creek-bed.</p>
<p>Smith showed no fear or curiosity&mdash;he knew
Indians too well to do either. His stoicism was
theirs under similar circumstances. Had they been
of his own race, his hope would have lain in throwing
himself upon their mercy; for twice the instinctive
sympathy of the white man for the under
dog, for the individual who fights against overwhelming
odds, had saved his life; but no such
tactics would avail him now.</p>
<p>His hope lay in playing upon their superstitions
and weaknesses; in winning their admiration,
if possible; and in devising means by which to
gain time. He knew that as soon as his absence
was discovered an effort would be made to rescue
him. He found some little comfort, too, in telling
himself that these reservation Indians, broken
in spirit by the white man&#8217;s laws and restrictions,
were not the Indians of the old days on the Big
Muddy and the Yellowstone. The fear of the
white man&#8217;s vengeance would keep them from going
too far. And so, as he rode, his hopes rose gradually;
his confidence, to a degree, returned; and
he even began to have a kind of curiosity as to
what form their attempted revenge would take.</p>
<p>The slowness of their progress down the creek-bed
had given him satisfaction, but once they left
the water, there was no cause for congratulation
as they quirted their horses at a breakneck speed
over rocks and gullies in the direction of the Bad
Lands. He could see that they had some definite
destination, for when the horses veered somewhat
to the south, Running Rabbit motioned them northward.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was there yesterday; Running Rabbit
knows,&#8221; said Bear Chief, in answer to an Indian&#8217;s
question; and Smith, listening, wondered where
&#8220;there&#8221; might be, and what it was that Running
Rabbit knew.</p>
<p>He asked himself if it could be that they were
taking him to some desert spring, where they
meant to tie him to die of thirst in sight of water.
The alkali plain held many forms of torture, as
he knew.</p>
<p>His captors did not taunt or insult him. They
rode too hard, they were too much in earnest, to
take the time for byplay. It was evident to Smith
that they feared pursuit, and were anxious to reach
their objective point before the sun rose. He knew
this from the manner in which they watched the east.</p>
<p>Somehow, as the miles sped under their horses&#8217;
feet, the ride became more and more unreal to Smith.
The moon, big, glorious, and late in rising, silvered
the desert with its white light until they looked to
be riding into an ocean. It made Smith think of
the Big Water, by moonlight, over there on the
Sundown slope. Even the lean, dark figures riding
beside him seemed a part of a dream; and Dora,
when he thought of her, was shadowy, unreal. He
had a strange feeling that he was galloping, galloping
out of her life.</p>

THEY QUIRTED THEIR HORSES AT BREAKNECK SPEED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE BAD LANDS.<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>There were times when he felt as if he were
floating. His sensations were like the hallucinations
of fever, and then he would find himself called back
to a realization of facts by the swish of leather
thongs on a horse&#8217;s flank, or some smothered, half-uttered
imprecation when a horse stumbled. The
air of the coming morning fanned his cheeks, its
coolness stimulated him, and something of the fairy-like
beauty of the white world around him impressed
even Smith.</p>
<p>They had left the flatter country behind them,
and were riding among hills and limestone cliffs,
Running Rabbit winding in and out with the certainty
of one on familiar ground. The way was
rough, and they slackened their pace, riding one
behind the other, Indian file.</p>
<p>Running Rabbit reined in where the moonlight
turned a limestone hill to silver, and threw up
his hand to halt.</p>
<p>He untied the rope which bound Smith&#8217;s hands
and feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t coil a rope no more nor a gopher,&#8221;
said Smith, watching him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The white man does many things better than
the Indian.&#8221; Running Rabbit went on coiling the
rope.</p>
<p>He motioned Smith to follow, and led the way
on foot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dotes on these moonlight picnics,&#8221; said Smith
sardonically, as he panted up the steep hills, his
high-heeled boots clattering among the rocks in
contrast to the silent footsteps of the Indian&#8217;s
moccasined feet.</p>
<p>Running Rabbit stopped where the limestone hill
had cracked, leaving a crevice wide at the top and
shallowing at the bottom.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a good place for a white man who
coils a rope so well, to rest,&#8221; he said, and seated
himself near the edge of the crevice, motioning
Smith to be seated also.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or for white men who shoot old Indians in
the back to think about what they have done.&#8221;
Yellow Bird joined them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or for smart thieves to tell where they left
their stolen horses.&#8221; Bear Chief dropped cross-legged
near them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or for those whose forked tongue talks love
to two women at once to use it for himself.&#8221; The
voice was sneering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Smith, you&#8217;re up against it!&#8221; the prisoner
said to himself.</p>
<p>As the others came up the hill, they enlarged
the half-circle which now faced him. Recovering
himself, he eyed them indifferently, one by one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have enemies, friends,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;White Antelope had no enemies,&#8221; Yellow Bird
replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Indian woman had no enemies,&#8221; said Running
Rabbit.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is our friends who steal our horses&#8221;&mdash;Bear
Chief&#8217;s voice was even and unemotional.</p>
<p>Their behavior puzzled Smith. They seemed now
to be in no hurry. Without gibes or jeers, they sat
as if waiting for something or somebody. What
was it? He asked himself the question over and
over again. They listened with interest to the
stories of his prowess and adventures. He flattered
them collectively and individually, and they
responded sometimes in praise as fulsome as has
own. All the knowledge, the tact, the wit, of which
he was possessed, he used to gain time. If only he
could hold them until the sun rose. But why had
they brought him there? With all his adroitness
and subtlety, he could get no inkling of their intentions.
The suspense got on Smith&#8217;s nerves,
though he gave no outward sign. The first gray
light of morning came, and still they waited. The
east flamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be hot to-day,&#8221; said Running Rabbit.
&#8220;The sky is red.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the sun showed itself, glowing like a red-hot
stove-lid shoved above the horizon.</p>
<p>In silence they watched the coming day.</p>
<p>&#8220;This limestone draws the heat,&#8221; said Smith,
and he laid aside his coat. &#8220;But it suits me. I
hates to be chilly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bear Chief stood up, and they all arose.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are like us&mdash;you like the sun. It is warm;
it is good. Look at it. Look long time, white
man!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was something ominous in his tone, and
Smith moistened his short upper lip with the tip
of his tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over there is the ranch where the white woman
lives. Look&mdash;look long time, white man!&#8221; He
swung his gaunt arm to the west.</p>
<p>&#8220;You make the big talk, Injun,&#8221; sneered Smith,
but his mouth was dry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up there is the sky where the clouds send
messages, where the sun shines to warm us and the
moon to light us. There&#8217;s antelope over there in
the foothills, and elk in the mountains, and sheep
on the peaks. You like to hunt, white man, same
as us. Look long time on all&mdash;for you will never
see it again!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sun rose higher and hotter while the Indian
talked. He had not finished speaking when Smith
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;God!&#8221;</p>
<p>A look of indescribable horror was on his face.
His skin had yellowed, and he stared into the crevice
at his feet. Now he understood! He knew why
they waited on the limestone hill! An odor, scarcely
perceptible as yet, but which, faint as it was, sickened
him, told him his fate. It was the unmistakable
odor of rattlesnakes!</p>
<p>The crevice below was a breeding-place, a rattlesnakes&#8217;
den. Smith had seen such places often, and
the stench which came from them when the sun
was hot was like nothing else in the world. The
recollection alone was almost enough to nauseate
him, and he always had ridden a wide circle at
the first whiff.</p>
<p>His aversion for snakes was like a pre-natal
mark. He avoided cowpunchers who wore rattlesnake
bands on their hats or stretched the skin over
the edge of the cantle of their saddles. He always
slept with a hair rope around his blankets when he
spent a night in the open. He would not sit in a
room where snake-rattles decorated the parlor
mantel or the organ. A curiosity as to how they
had learned his peculiarity crept through the paralyzing
horror which numbed him, and as if in answer
the scene in the dining-room of the ranch rose before
him. &#8220;I hates snakes and mouse-traps goin&#8217;
off,&#8221; he had said. Yes, he remembered.</p>
<p>The Indians looked at his yellow skin and at
his eyes in which the horror stayed, and laughed.
He did not struggle when they stood him, mute,
upon his feet and bound him, for Smith knew Indians.
His lips and chin trembled; his throat,
dry and contracted, made a clicking sound when
he swallowed. His knees shook, and he had no
power to control the twitching muscles of his arms
and legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;He dances,&#8221; said Yellow Bird.</p>
<p>As the sun rose higher and streamed into the
crevice, the overpowering odor increased with the
heat. The yellow of Smith&#8217;s skin took on a greenish
tinge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; An Indian laid his hand upon his
stomach. &#8220;Me sick!&#8221;</p>
<p>A bit of limestone fell into the crevice and
bounded from one shelf of rock to the other. Upon
each ledge a nest of rattlesnakes basked in the
sun, and a chorus of hisses followed the fall of
the stone.</p>
<p>&#8220;They sing! Their voices are strong to-day,&#8221;
said Running Rabbit.</p>
<p>The Indians threw Smith upon the edge of the
crevice, face downward, so that he could look below.
With his staring, bloodshot eyes he saw them
all&mdash;dozens of them&mdash;a hundred or more! Crawling
on the shelves and in the bottom, writhing, wriggling,
hissing, coiled to strike! Every marking,
every shading, every size&mdash;Smith saw them all with
his bulging, fascinated eyes. The Indians stoned
them until a forked tongue darted from every
mouth and every wicked eye flamed red.</p>
<p>The thick rope was tied under Smith&#8217;s arms, and
a noose thrown over a huge rock. They shoved him
over the edge&mdash;slowly&mdash;looking at him and each
other, laughing a little at the sound of reptile fury
from below. It was the end. Smith&#8217;s eyes opened
before they let him drop, and his lips drew back
from his white, slightly protruding teeth. They
thought he meant to beg at last, and, rejoicing,
waited. He looked like a coyote, a coyote when its
ribs are crushed, its legs broken; when its eyes
are blurred with the death film, and its mouth drips
blood. He gathered himself&mdash;he was all but fainting&mdash;and
threw back his head, looking at Bear
Chief. He snarled&mdash;there was no tenderness in his
voice when he gave the message:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell <i>her</i>, you damned Injuns&mdash;tell the Schoolmarm
I died game, me&mdash;Smith!&#8221;</p>

<p>A Love Story with a musical atmosphere.
A picturesque, old
German virtuoso is the reverent
possessor of a genuine Cremona.
He consents to take as
his pupil a handsome youth who
proves to have an aptitude for
technique, but not the soul of
the artist. The youth has led the
happy, careless life of a modern,
well-to-do young American, and
he cannot, with his meagre past,
express the love, the longing, the passion and the tragedies
of life and its happy phases as can the master who
has lived life in all its fulness. But a girl comes into
his existence, a beautiful bit of human driftwood that
his aunt had taken into her heart and home; and through
his passionate love for her, he learns the lessons that life
has to give&mdash;and his soul awakens.</p>
<p>Founded on a fact well known among artists, but not
often recognized or discussed.</p>

<p style='font-size:1.6em;'>The Prodigal Judge</p>
<p>By VAUGHAN KESTER</p>
</div>

<p>This great novel&mdash;probably the most popular book in
this country to-day&mdash;is as human as a story from the pen
of that great master of &#8220;immortal laughter and immortal
tears,&#8221; Charles Dickens.</p>
<p>The Prodigal Judge is a shabby outcast, a tavern hanger-on,
a genial wayfarer who tarries longest where the inn
is most hospitable, yet with that suavity, that distinctive
politeness and that saving grace of humor peculiar to the
American man. He has his own code of morals&mdash;very
exalted ones&mdash;but honors them in the breach rather than
in the observance.</p>
<p>Clinging to the Judge closer than a brother, is Solomon
Mahaffy&mdash;fallible and failing like the rest of us, but with
a sublime capacity for friendship; and closer still, perhaps,
clings little Hannibal, a boy about whose parentage
nothing is known until the end of the story. Hannibal
is charmed into tolerance of the Judge&#8217;s picturesque
vices, while Miss Betty, lovely and capricious, is charmed
into placing all her affairs, both material and sentimental,
in the hands of this delightful old vagabond.</p>
<p>The Judge will be a fixed star in the firmament of
fictional characters as surely as David Harum or Col.
Sellers. He is a source of infinite delight, while this story
of Mr. Kester&#8217;s is one of the finest examples of American
literary craftmanship.</p>
